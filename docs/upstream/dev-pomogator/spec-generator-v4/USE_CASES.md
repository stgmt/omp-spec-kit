# Use Cases

## UC-1

**Agent traces requirement to test result end-to-end (happy path)**

AI agent работает над feature, нужно понять состояние FR-001 — спека ↔ тесты ↔ результат.

- Agent invokes MCP tool `get_trace("FR-001")`
- MCP server returns full SpecGraph slice: FR-001 metadata + 2 ACs + 3 scenarios with `lastResult` (PASSED/FAILED) + 2 tasks + code refs from Cucumber step bindings + natural-language `explanation_for_agent` field
- Agent reasons over the response without any follow-up file reads
- Result: agent has complete context for the requirement in single tool call (~50ms latency)

**Developer edits FR, gets immediate conformance feedback**

Developer modifies `### FR-001: Login` heading to clarify wording.

- Developer (or agent) Edit-s `.specs/auth/FR.md`
- PostToolUse hook fires, incremental reindex affected file (<100ms)
- Conformance check runs on affected scope (FR-001 + linked scenarios)
- Within 3-second throttle window: findings batch + dedupe
- After window closes: aggregated `<system-reminder>` injected into agent context with bounded findings summary (total count, severity counts, sample findings, omitted count, and full-log pointer)
- Agent decides whether to update scenarios or inspect the full audit journal

**Developer migrates dev-pomogator from vitest pseudo-BDD to cucumber-js (Phase 0)**

dev-pomogator team migrates own BDD tests as Phase 0 prerequisite for v4.

- Run `npm install @cucumber/cucumber @cucumber/messages`
- Move existing `.feature` files from `.specs/{slug}/*.feature` references (already present)
- Create `tests/step_definitions/*.ts` with step impls (extracted from current vitest tests)
- Configure `cucumber.json`: `format: message:.dev-pomogator/.last-test-run.ndjson`
- CI updated to run both: `npm run test:unit` (vitest) + `npm run test:bdd` (cucumber-js)
- Verify NDJSON output parseable via `@cucumber/messages` package
- Result: real BDD trace pipeline, vitest unit tests untouched

**Existing v3 user upgrades to v4 (Phase 5 migration)**

Team has 25 specs in v3 format, wants to use v4 graph features.

- Run `dev-pomogator migrate-v3-to-v4 --suggest-only`
- Output: per-file diff preview (heading conversions `### Requirement: FR-N` → `### FR-N:`, frontmatter additions, anchor changes)
- Team reviews diffs in PR-like format, decides what to migrate
- Run `dev-pomogator migrate-v3-to-v4` (interactive mode)
- Tool prompts approve/skip/edit per file
- After migration: `.spec-config.json` created with defaults; `.progress.json` bumped to version 4
- Legacy `### Requirement:` headings still work via triple-anchor (backward compat)
- Result: smooth upgrade, no data loss, can roll back per file

**Maintainer designs new major feature using architecture-research-workflow (Phase 6)**

Maxim wants to design v5 spec-generator features. Invokes new skill standalone.

- Maxim: "архитектурный ресерч под v5 spec-generator: интеграция с GitHub Issues + Jira"
- Skill auto-triggers `Skill("architecture-research-workflow")`
- Stage 0: structured 3-Q intake (symptom / suspected cause / desired outcome)
- Stage 1: External pain validation (GitHub issues mining, competitive landscape)
- Stage 2: Broad research via `Skill("research-workflow")` (3 parallel angles)
- Stage 3: Self-pushback + focused research (1-2 cycles)
- Stage 4: 4 architecture variants with reuse vs custom matrix
- Stage 5: Iterative decision Q&A loop (AskUserQuestion per decision)
- Stage 6: Phased rollout planning
- Stage 7: Hand-off to `create-spec` (auto-populated RESEARCH.md)
- Result: full spec discovery done in 5-8 turns instead of 30+

**Developer adds untagged Scenario during red-phase TDD**

Developer writes failing test FIRST, before defining FR.

- Developer creates `.feature` file with `Scenario: New auth flow` (no `@FR-N` tag)
- Saves file → PostToolUse hook fires → conformance_check
- Finding: `UNTAGGED_SCENARIO` severity=warning (not error, not block)
- Push to agent context: "1 untagged scenario detected — typical for red-phase TDD; tag with @FR-N when FR is defined"
- Developer continues: writes step defs, runs test, sees RED
- Later: defines FR-007 in `FR.md`, adds `@FR-007` tag to scenario
- Conformance now clean

## UC-7

**Two Claude Code sessions on same project (Phase 4)**

Developer opens two terminals: one for feature work, one for debugging session.

- Session A starts in `D:\repos\my-project` → MCP server starts, writes `.dev-pomogator/.mcp-lock.json` (pid=A_PID, env=host)
- Session B starts in same directory → detects lock, validates `process.kill(A_PID, 0)` succeeds → same env
- Session B reuses Session A's MCP server (single process serves both clients)
- Session A modifies `.specs/auth/FR.md`
- Session B immediately sees fresh data via `get_trace("FR-001")` (SQLite single-writer ensures consistency)
- Session A crashes (kill -9)
- Session C starts → detects stale lock (process.kill fails ESRCH) → deletes lock, starts fresh MCP

**Developer in devcontainer hits bind-mount file-watch issue**

Developer uses VS Code Remote-Containers on Docker Desktop Windows.

- Inside container: `claude` CLI starts, dev-pomogator v4 MCP server spawns
- MCP server runs touch-test on workspace bind mount: creates temp file, waits for chokidar event
- Event not received within 500ms → auto-fallback to polling mode (1s interval)
- Logs: `[chokidar] bind-mount detected, polling mode enabled`
- Developer modifies `.specs/auth/FR.md` from host (VS Code Remote)
- Polling detects change within ~1s → graph incremental rebuild → PostToolUse fires
- Result: works correctly despite known Docker Desktop bind-mount FS event reliability issues

**Agent attempts to write malformed spec (HARD-block edge case)**

Agent generates new FR but introduces duplicate ID by accident.

- Agent attempts Write `.specs/auth/FR.md` with content `### FR-001: New Login` (FR-001 already exists)
- PreToolUse hook intercepts: parses incoming content, runs structural validation
- Finding: `DUPLICATE_DEFINITION` for FR-001 — two locations
- Hook DENIES with response: `permissionDecision: "deny"`, `permissionDecisionReason: "FR-001 already defined at .specs/auth/FR.md:12. Choose a new ID (suggested: FR-008) or modify existing FR."`
- Agent sees DENY in tool result, regenerates with FR-008
- Write succeeds on retry

**User runs cucumber-js test, agent uses fresh NDJSON**

Developer triggers test run, then agent investigates.

- Developer runs `npm run test:bdd` in terminal
- cucumber-js executes, generates `.dev-pomogator/.last-test-run.ndjson`
- Bash hook (separate from PostToolUse) detects `dotnet test` / `npm test` completion via Bash output pattern
- Post-test hook: invokes MCP `ingest-ndjson` tool, splits master NDJSON by spec slug, writes per-spec `.specs/{slug}/.test-results.ndjson`
- Agent (working on FR-003) calls `get_trace("FR-003")` → response includes fresh `lastResult: "FAILED"` for SCEN-x with stack trace

**Lightweight cross-spec reconcile during Phase 2 / Phase 3 of create-spec**

Spec author runs `create-spec` workflow on a new feature; create-spec invokes lightweight reconcile twice (at STOP #2 gate and STOP #3 gate).

- Author reaches Phase 2 step 4d after requirements-chk-matrix finishes
- create-spec invokes `Skill("cross-spec-reconcile", mode: "light")` automatically
- Skill globs `.specs/*/{FR,DESIGN,NFR,SCHEMA}.md` + `.specs/*/*.feature`, builds per-spec concept index
- Mechanical checks run: terminology drift (Jaccard on FR title nouns), file existence (`fs.exists` on declared paths), runtime-identifier drift (levenshtein on extracted identifiers), module ownership conflict (exact path overlap)
- All findings written to `.specs/{slug}/consistency-report.yaml` atomically (temp file + rename)
- If any CRITICAL finding from hard-conflict subset (`cross-spec/runtime-identifier-drift`, `cross-spec/module-ownership-conflict`, `cross-spec/contradictory-fr`) — emit blocking AskUserQuestion with `header: "⚠️ CRIT"` listing offending spec_a/spec_b + suggested_fix; user must choose Fix / Acknowledge / Abort
- Same step repeated at Phase 3 step 1c after task-board-forms finishes (catches drift introduced by new TASKS.md content)

**Heavyweight reconcile during Phase 3+ Audit**

After STOP #3 (Finalization confirmed), Phase 3+ Audit dispatches 9 categories including the new CROSS_SPEC_CONSISTENCY category.

- create-spec Audit dispatcher invokes `Skill("cross-spec-reconcile", mode: "full")`
- Skill runs all light-mode mechanical checks
- Additionally invokes Agent tool subagent for pairwise FR/AC semantic compare (pre-filtered to pairs sharing ≥3 concept nouns; cached by sha256 content hash to avoid re-evaluating unchanged pairs)
- Subagent returns structured JSON `{verdict: contradiction|overlap|complementary, confidence, snippets}` per pair; outer skill aggregates into YAML `findings[]`
- If subagent fails on some pairs, YAML gets `partial: true` flag + warning (not fail-loud)
- All 28 finding codes can fire in full mode; CRITICAL findings trigger same blocking AskUserQuestion flow as UC-17
- YAML is enriched with `recommendations[]` block (priority + action + impact) plus `summary` dashboard (by_severity, by_class per OpenFastTrace 4-class, by_namespace, totals)
- Optionally writes `.specs/{slug}/consistency-report.sarif` if `--sarif` flag or project config opts in

## UC-19

**Resolve loop on user demand**

Spec author has reconcile YAML; invokes `/cross-spec-resolve` to walk through findings interactively.

- Author runs `/cross-spec-resolve` (NOT auto-invoked from create-spec — explicit user command)
- Skill loads `.specs/{slug}/consistency-report.yaml`; exits with hint «Run /cross-spec-reconcile first» if missing
- Findings grouped by severity (CRITICAL → WARNING → INFO) and category; deduplicated by code+spec_a+spec_b+location
- For each finding: emit 5-field explanation block (code+severity+class, files+lines, plain-language change, WHY-from-finding, suggested options); wait for AskUserQuestion confirm (Apply / Skip / Defer)
- Mechanical fixes (`impl-drift/missing-file`, `impl-drift/stale-reference`, `impl-drift/mcp-tool-drift`, `impl-drift/hook-registration-drift`) applied via Edit/Write after confirm
- Deferred findings: `resolution_status: deferred`, `defer_reason: <text>` written to YAML, no Edit performed
- After all findings processed (batch), invoke `Skill("cross-spec-reconcile", mode: "full")` once; update each finding's `resolution_status` based on presence in new report (`resolved` / `still_present` / `transformed`)

## UC-20

**Architectural fork resolution (Path A/B/C)**

Resolve encounters an `impl-drift/architectural-decision-vs-reality` finding (spec claims architecture X, code shape shows Y).

- Skill identifies finding class as architectural; loads fix-templates entry for the code
- Pre-computed code shape (exports, module boundaries, declared ports, MCP tools, hooks) is passed to Agent subagent along with the FR/DESIGN prose claim
- Subagent returns 2-3 Path alternatives with pros / cons / impacted_files per path
- Outer skill emits AskUserQuestion with each Path as an option; `description` field of each option contains the pros/cons/impacted-files prose
- Architect selects one Path; skill generates patch plan listing every impacted file
- Each impacted file goes through its own per-finding confirm cycle (Apply / Skip / Defer)
- If any impacted file lives in another spec (`.specs/{other-slug}/`), additional foreign-spec confirm banner appears
- `cross-spec/duplicate-infrastructure` and `cross-spec/duty-delegation-ambiguity` findings also use this Path A/B/C flow

## UC-21

**Cross-spec stale-state correction via foreign-spec edit**

Reconcile detects `cross-spec/stale-spec-outstanding-but-done` (spec A's README/CHANGELOG claims a gap that is actually closed by code in another sprint).

- Resolve loads the finding; identifies target = `.specs/{other-slug}/README.md` (or CHANGELOG.md)
- Explanation block includes both the per-finding 5-field structure AND the additional «⚠️ This edits foreign spec: .specs/{other-slug}/{file}» banner
- Two confirms required: the per-finding confirm («Apply this fix?») and the foreign-spec confirm («Confirm editing foreign spec?»)
- On dual-confirm, skill applies Edit to mark the gap closed in the foreign spec (e.g., strikethrough on the «Outstanding gap» bullet plus changelog entry)
- Foreign spec slug owner is not notified automatically (out of scope); commit history preserves the edit attribution

## UC-24

**Unified readiness answer for a spec with split evidence**

A maintainer reviews a spec after implementation, but the raw surfaces disagree: task text says DONE, canonical coverage has not_run scenarios, a focused Docker run passed, and executable BDD scenarios may not match source spec scenarios.

- Maintainer asks for readiness through `spec-verdict` or MCP status.
- The system computes lanes from one graph and evidence set: structure/audit, traceability, execution, task truth, BDD source↔executable sync, semantic status, and filtered proof.
- The result reports `OVERALL: NOT_READY` when any lane has blocking or honesty debt, even if structural traceability passes.
- Task truth uses canonical coverage and `Done When` evidence; textual `Status: DONE` is denied/downgraded when evidence is missing.
- BDD sync compares `.specs/<slug>/<slug>.feature` against configured executable feature paths and flags source-only/executable-only/scenario-count/tag drift unless explicitly marked.
- Filtered Docker artifacts are shown as review evidence (`FILTERED_PROOF`) without overwriting canonical full-run coverage.
- The response ends with one concrete next action: run full Docker BDD, attach/accept the filtered artifact, fix BDD sync drift, or reopen/downgrade tasks.

## Edge Cases

### EC-1: Spec file deleted while MCP server running

Developer manually deletes `.specs/old-feature/`. Chokidar fires `unlink` events for all files in folder. Graph builder removes all nodes from deleted slug. References in OTHER specs to deleted IDs become `BROKEN_REF` findings on next conformance check.

### EC-2: Cucumber-js NDJSON partial output (test run crashed mid-execution)

`reqnroll_report.ndjson` exists but missing `testRunFinished` envelope (only `testRunStarted` + some `testStepFinished`). NDJSON ingester detects truncation, populates partial results, marks `incomplete_run: true` in graph metadata; `latest_test_results` flag scenarios with status `INCOMPLETE` instead of treating as PASSED.

### EC-3: Wiki-link with case mismatch (`[[fr-001]]` vs `[[FR-001]]`)

Custom MD parser normalizes anchor lookups case-insensitively for our ID schemes (FR, NFR, AC, SCEN). Marksman is case-sensitive by default. Solution: register all anchor variants explicitly (FR-001, fr-001) so both work.

### EC-4: Migration tool encounters non-standard heading (`### Story 1: X`)

User has historical convention not matching v3 default. Migration `--suggest-only` shows: "Unrecognized heading pattern at line 42 — skipping. To migrate, add custom pattern to `anchor_patterns.STORY` in `.spec-config.json`."

### EC-5: PostToolUse push happens during agent's middle of long reasoning

Hook fires during agent's mid-response generation. Anthropic API delivers `<system-reminder>` between turns, not mid-turn — agent sees push at next user/tool message boundary. Throttling 3s reduces probability of mid-thought interruption.

### EC-6: User runs `cucumber-js` for one .feature file at a time (per-spec invocation)

Edge case for `bdd_runner.per_spec_split: false` config. NDJSON output is per-run, one file per `.feature`. v4 supports this mode — splits by inspecting `gherkinDocument.uri` field in NDJSON.

### EC-7: Wiki-link points to FR in archived spec

`.specs/archive/old-feature/FR.md` contains FR-001. New spec `[[FR-001]]` resolves to archived one. Default behavior: resolve + warn (`ARCHIVED_REF` finding). Configurable via `anchor_patterns.allow_archive_refs: false` to error.

### EC-8: Marksman crashes during runtime

MCP server detects via process exit code. Logs warning, falls back to custom JS MD LSP. `get_trace` continues to work; IDE wiki-link navigation degrades. Auto-restart Marksman attempted every 30s; if 3 consecutive failures — disable for session.

### EC-9: Devcontainer + WSL2 simultaneously (e.g., WSL host + Docker container on top)

Path resolution: container sees `/workspace/...`; WSL host sees `/mnt/wsl/dev-pomogator/...`. MCP scope = per-env (container env tagged separately from WSL env). User opens Claude Code in WSL → separate MCP from any container Claude Code session.

### EC-10: User edits 50 spec files in bulk script

Bulk migration script touches 50 files via Edit tool. Without throttling: 50 PostToolUse pushes within 10 seconds. With 3s throttle + aggregation: 3-4 pushes total, each summarizing batch.

### EC-11: SQLite file becomes corrupt (Phase 4)

MCP server start: SQLite integrity check (`PRAGMA integrity_check`) fails. Auto-fallback to in-memory rebuild + warning logged. Corrupted file moved to `.dev-pomogator/.spec-index.sqlite.corrupt-{timestamp}` for postmortem.

### EC-12: User invokes `architecture-research-workflow` on tiny feature (Phase 6)

Auto-detection should prevent this, but user can force via `--use-arch-research`. Skill detects scope mismatch in Stage 0 problem-framing: if symptom is single-line bug, skill prompts: "This appears small (1-2 files affected). Continue with 7-stage workflow or downgrade to `research-workflow`? [downgrade/continue]"

## UC-25

**Windows-hosted agent obtains WSL-hosted readiness**

A maintainer invokes an installed plugin cached outside the WSL target project, reproducing GitHub issue #126.

- The precheck resolves the target root in strict precedence: environment override `SPECS_GENERATOR_ROOT`, then a valid caller/project cwd, then `SCRIPT_DIR` only as a final fallback.
- The plugin-cache `SCRIPT_DIR` is never treated as the target project merely because the script itself exists there.
- Inherited noninteractive stdin is handled independently: the precheck and MCP path do not wait for input before applying the root-precedence rule.
- The result reports which resolution source was selected, so diagnosis distinguishes environment override, caller project, and fallback.
- Required release tracked-file inventory belongs to FR-64, not this #126 root-resolution use case.

## UC-26

**Release candidate proves installed-plugin readiness without development dependencies**

A release candidate is installed into an isolated plugin fixture where repository `node_modules` are unavailable.

- The fixture invokes the documented `spec-status` entrypoint and a representative MCP readiness request through the installed launcher.
- Both paths resolve only bundled or declared runtime assets.
- A missing runtime asset or undeclared import makes verification fail with the import/asset named; source-tree success does not override this failure.

## UC-27

**New readiness requirements retain graph-native traceability**

An author introduces the Windows/WSL, installed-runtime, and readiness-evidence requirements during the requirements phase.

- Each new FR uses the canonical graph-parseable heading and points to one user story and one use case.
- The linked US and UC point back to the FR using the same identifier.
- Conformance rebuilds the graph and rejects a requirement whose identifier is malformed or lacks its user-story edge with `FR_NO_STORY` or the applicable identifier finding.

## UC-28

**Every readiness surface agrees on mandatory graph evidence**

A maintainer checks a spec through the CLI, MCP, and verdict while its graph contains acceptance criteria, discovered scenarios, and a mixture of current and stale evidence.

- `spec-status`, the MCP result, and `spec-verdict` consume the same graph snapshot and evidence classification.
- AC-to-scenario discovery and evidence recency are mandatory AND-readiness lanes: a result is ready only when every required lane is current and satisfied.
- A missing discovery edge, absent evidence, or stale evidence produces the same NOT_READY reason and next action through all three surfaces.
- A passing subset, filtered proof, or structural-only green result cannot overwrite a failing mandatory lane.

## UC-29

**Release owner finalizes and operates the readiness release**

A release owner finalizes the GitHub #45 test-isolation change through its linked PR, tag, and published release.

- Before release, the owner records the affected test-isolation inventory and binds it to the proposed artifact.
- At release, the finalization record links the installed-plugin dependency-absent proof to the exact PR, tag, release, and artifact.
- After release, it names an accountable owner, a monitoring signal, and a rollback target or procedure.
- Publication readiness is denied until pre-release inventory, release evidence, and post-release controls are all present; a source-tree test result alone is insufficient.
- If monitoring detects installed-runtime failure, the release owner follows the recorded rollback path and preserves the inventory and evidence trail.

## UC-30

**Generator expands and audits a paid deployed API contract**

A feature request claims a public catalog/policy surface and an authenticated paid execution flow. The generator classifies each AC, emits an AC-linked coverage plan, and refuses Finalization until every required lane is owned.

- Public response claims map to source-of-truth/DTO work, contract regression, and semantic live readback.
- Version, UI input, and redaction claims map to compatibility or explicit design decisions.
- Paid execution maps to unauthenticated, insufficient-balance, funded success, idempotent settlement, and artifact/result readback proof.
- An unknown implementation surface becomes a blocking investigation task rather than disappearing.

## UC-31: Create an execution-aware, safe parallel task plan

**Primary actor:** Spec author or implementation agent.

**Goal:** Turn canonical typed tasks into an explainable execution plan that maximizes safe parallelism while preserving dependencies, declared resource conflicts, and evidence freshness.

**Preconditions:**

- The input contains canonical task records or imported legacy prose tasks.
- A canonical task may declare dependency IDs, an estimate, task-owned evidence, and surfaces classified as `read`, `write`, or `exclusive` for files, symbols, contracts, configuration, data, tests, or runtime resources.
- Legacy `_depends` text is available only as a migration hint unless it can be resolved to concrete task IDs.

**Trigger:** The actor asks the planner to create or refresh the execution plan for a selected task set.

**Main success flow:**

1. The planner loads task records and preserves legacy prose, raw completion text, waivers, phase, status, and references.
2. It validates typed dependency IDs, rejects cycles, and computes dependency-ready antichains.
3. It normalizes declared surfaces, derives conflict edges from overlap, and retains the contributing surface identities for explanation.
4. It splits each dependency-ready antichain into conflict-free batches; conflicts constrain concurrency but do not silently become dependency edges.
5. It computes critical path and slack from estimates and the dependency DAG, clearly identifying unavailable or assumed estimates.
6. It verifies each task-owned evidence record against its input digests and marks evidence stale when a declared input or transitive prerequisite changed.
7. It returns waves, batches, conflict explanations, dependency explanations, critical-path/slack results, evidence freshness, and migration warnings.

**Extensions:**

- If a task is a bounded discovery task, the planner limits traversal depth, candidate count, and elapsed work; it emits candidate dependencies or surfaces as a graph-patch proposal for validation instead of editing the graph.
- If a surface is missing or ambiguous, the plan records a blocking investigation or conservative conflict; it does not claim the tasks are safe to run in parallel.
- If a legacy task has prose-only dependencies, the plan remains readable but labels the relation unresolved and asks for a typed migration decision.
- If estimates are absent, the planner still emits dependency and conflict waves, but reports critical-path/slack values as unavailable or explicitly assumed.

**Postconditions:**

- Every parallel batch is both dependency-ready and conflict-free according to declared knowledge.
- The canonical dependency DAG remains distinct from the derived conflict graph.
- Existing prose tasks remain intact and have an explicit compatibility/migration path.
- Discovery never applies an unreviewed graph change, and stale evidence cannot be presented as fresh task proof.

## UC-32: Synthesize proof-owning vertical tasks before scheduling

**Goal:** turn FR, mandatory AC lanes, DESIGN decisions, and linked BDD scenarios into canonical task records before blast-radius analysis and dependency-DAG planning.

**Trigger:** A maintainer requests an execution plan for a changed requirement set.

**Main flow:**

1. The synthesizer collects FR, every mandatory AC lane, DESIGN decisions, linked BDD scenarios, and available implementation surfaces.
2. It reads `domainMode`. With `ddd`, it performs DDD boundary analysis for evidenced aggregates, invariants, and contracts. With `none`, it uses module, adapter, and contract boundaries and does not invent domain objects.
3. It creates vertical acceptance slices, conserving every mandatory AC lane and assigning each slice an owner, affected surfaces, BDD proof, and an ordered BDD-only TDD chain: RED, GREEN, then REFACTOR.
4. It emits canonical task records with requirement/AC/scenario links, ownership, surfaces, evidence policy, and TDD order.
5. If a needed implementation surface remains unknown, it emits a BLOCKED investigation task with its owner, unresolved surface, and evidence needed to unblock it; it does not fabricate a surface or mark the task READY.
6. Only then do downstream blast-radius analysis and DAG planning consume the canonical records; they preserve blocked state and acceptance-lane ownership.

**Outcome:** scheduling is derived from a complete, evidence-owning task model rather than from prose or speculative domain structure.

**Linked stories:** US-60



### UC-32 execution-agent handoff amendment

1. The agent requests `TaskPlanResult` from canonical SpecGraph data.
2. It receives a self-contained `TaskBrief`: full task text, approved-design/responsibility context, exact files/source ranges, interfaces, dependencies, relevant predecessor summaries, scenario/evidence command, blockers, safe batch, independence proof, and machine next action.
3. It performs nested 2–5-minute BDD-only RED/GREEN/REFACTOR steps for the canonical AC/BDD vertical task, never treating a micro-step as a separate graph task.
4. It reports `DONE` only with task-owned evidence, otherwise `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`, `NEEDS_CONTEXT`, or `BLOCKED` with diagnostics and a follow-up proposal.
5. It parallelizes only a batch whose every pair has no causal path in either direction and no conflict pair. No second plan store or executor is introduced.


## UC-33

**Cursor second-client install and door smoke**

**Goal:** enable Cursor on a tree that already has Claude Code / `.claude` without a second plugin.

**Trigger:** Developer opens the repo in Cursor after Claude Code dogfood or plugin install.

**Main flow:**

1. Confirm Claude Code install is unchanged (skills/hooks/root `.mcp.json`).
2. Enable Cursor Settings → Third-party skills/hooks.
3. Ensure `.cursor/mcp.json` exists (committed twin, `ensure-cursor-mcp.ts`, or copy from root `.mcp.json`).
4. Reload Cursor; verify MCP catalog includes `dev-pomogator-specs`.
5. Smoke: MCP read/`get_spec_status`; under enforce, raw `.specs` Write denied; MCP `apply_spec_change` succeeds.

**Outcome:** One door, two hosts; install delta is one MCP file + toggle.

## UC-34

**Bounded task inventory and truthful read-side queries**

**Goal:** Give an agent every unfinished task for one spec and enough bounded read context to act without an N×M MCP crawl.

**Trigger:** The agent needs task inventory, phase tasks, search results, summary status, or a document section while the graph is live and larger than one prompt-safe page.

**Main flow:**

1. Request `list_tasks` with the spec and optional status, phase, requirement, comment, limit, and cursor filters.
2. Follow deterministic cursors until `truncated` is false; validate total/returned cardinality and stable task IDs.
3. Use spec-scoped `list_phase_tasks` or `search` for bounded follow-up, distinguishing `PHASE_NOT_FOUND` from `EMPTY_PHASE`.
4. Request `get_spec_status` with `view: "summary"` for compact routing state instead of a full inventory payload.
5. Request a bounded `read_spec_doc` page; use nearest canonical heading/anchor suggestions when a section is missing.
6. Run only the declared bounded verification against the real captured corpus/incident artifact.

**Failure paths:** A page budget, byte budget, or latency budget is exceeded; a cursor is invalidated by a graph revision; an unknown phase is requested; or a section is absent. Each outcome is explicit and actionable, never a silent empty result.

**Outcome:** Complete, deterministic, bounded query results whose cardinality and source locations are inspectable.

## UC-35

**Install and operate spec-generator-v4 from Codex Desktop**

**Goal:** Run the complete existing spec workflow in Codex Desktop against an arbitrary target repository without a second spec engine or manually maintained Codex copy.

**Trigger:** A developer installs the full `spec-generator-v4` marketplace entry and opens a project containing or creating `.specs/`.

**Main flow:**

1. Install `spec-generator-v4@dev-pomogator-codex` into an isolated or normal Codex home; keep `context-menu` independently installable.
2. Reload plugins or start a fresh Desktop task and verify that packaged skills, hooks, and the `dev-pomogator-specs` MCP catalog match the canonical registries.
3. Resolve the target repository independently of the plugin-cache cwd and initialize the shared SpecGraph once.
4. Use MCP reads and mutations for discovery, requirements, finalization, status, and audit; verify every handler remains confined to the target root.
5. Normalize Codex hook payloads and prove the enforce guard denies a raw `.specs/**` patch or shell write while allowing the MCP mutation path.
6. Run a workflow phase through the host adapter using a native Codex subagent or built-in fallback, retaining the existing gate/retry/STOP semantics.
7. Run doctor and dependency-absent package checks, then capture a fresh Desktop live-evidence record for the installed path.

**Failure paths:** Plugin catalog drift, generated adapter drift, cache/target root mismatch, unsupported hook event, absent host spawn path, missing judge path, dependency leak, or missing live evidence leaves the feature NOT_READY with a named next action. None is converted into a successful fallback silently.

**Outcome:** The developer gets one canonical spec system through a Codex host adapter; repository and installed modes differ only at the distribution/root boundary.

**Feature:** @feature85

**Author and verify every FR through a typed contract card**

**Goal:** Make each functional requirement independently implementable and verifiable without forcing every requirement into a CLI-shaped template.

**Trigger:** A maintainer creates a new FR, reviews an existing FR, or migrates a legacy spec into strict contract mode.

**Main flow:**

1. The authoring workflow reads the FR, linked AC/UC/story, DESIGN, SCHEMA, FILE_CHANGES, and available repository reality.
2. It selects exactly one contract kind from the closed registry: CLI, API, schema, filesystem, event, state, behavior, or disposition. Disposition inherits the common observable/negative/verification card and adds lifecycle fields.
3. It fills the common card fields and the kind-specific boundary fields.
4. It adds at least one observable result, one negative/adversarial outcome, and a verification policy.
5. The MCP door validates the card before writing and the graph stores it on the qualified FR node.
6. Conformance checks the card and traceability edges; spec-verdict evaluates the CONTRACT lane alongside structure, execution, evidence, and semantic lanes.
7. The migration report handles legacy FRs in suggest-only mode until an owner resolves every clarification marker.

**Failure paths:** The FR has no observable boundary; the selected kind lacks required fields; the negative case is absent; the card references an unresolved AC/scenario or implementation surface; the metadata version is unsupported; or an agent attempts to disable strict mode. Each outcome remains an actionable NOT_READY finding.

**Outcome:** Every in-scope FR has a typed contract that can be rendered, parsed, traced, tested, and checked against implementation/evidence without a second spec format or a prose-only escape.

## UC-37
**Feature:** @feature86

**Inspect and author through the core agent UX contract**

**Goal:** Give a coding agent one truthful, actionable non-dashboard contract for readiness, evidence, safe authoring, and remediation.

**Trigger:** The agent queries a spec, ingests supported execution evidence, prepares a requirement card, or requests a spec mutation from a worktree.

**Main flow:**

1. The agent requests the canonical SpecVerdictResult and receives one overall readiness state, grouped blockers, affected-node counts, and deterministic next actions.
2. The agent inspects an FR and receives its derived evidence_state with the inputs, producer/run/source/timestamp/URI-line provenance, and any stale or quality demotion reason.
3. When scenario-level evidence is absent from a supported producer receipt, the agent receives NOT_INGESTED; genuinely unexecuted scenarios remain NOT_RUN.
4. Before any mutation, the door reports its resolved root, worktree, lock/write mode, plugin/MCP version, and dependency readiness; a root mismatch refuses before disk access.
5. The agent selects a contract kind and receives evidence-backed required and missing fields, field-level findings, and an exact preview before CAS/atomic apply through the existing door.
6. The agent follows the ordered remediation actions until the canonical result changes; no dashboard or Plane surface is introduced.

**Failure paths:** A status surface tries to project an incompatible top-level verdict; evidence is weak, stale, unbound, or lacks location identity; a producer or dependency is absent; the declared worktree differs from the resolved root; or a card proposal is invalid or stale under CAS. Each path returns a stable, actionable non-success result and performs no unsafe write.

**Outcome:** CLI, MCP, spec-verdict, and statusline views remain compatible projections of one canonical result, while agents can author and remediate safely without a second parser, store, dashboard, or vendor UI.
