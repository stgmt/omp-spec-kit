Feature: SPECGEN004 Spec Generator v4 — graph + MCP + LSP + cucumber-js BDD
  As a dev-pomogator maintainer / developer
  I want an in-memory SpecGraph + MCP server exposing get_trace tool + Marksman LSP + cucumber-js BDD with NDJSON
  So that AI agents trace FR↔Scenario↔TestResult automatically without hallucinating spec connections

  Background:
    Given dev-pomogator v4 is installed
    And specs-workflow extension is enabled with MCP server registered
    And the project has at least one spec in `.specs/`

  @feature1 @AC-1.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_01 Phase 0 — cucumber-js generates canonical NDJSON output
    Given dev-pomogator package.json has `@cucumber/cucumber` and `@cucumber/messages` deps installed
    And `cucumber.json` config has `format: "message:.dev-pomogator/.last-test-run.ndjson"`
    And `tests/step_definitions/` contains step impls for `.feature` files
    When the developer runs `npm run test:bdd`
    Then `.dev-pomogator/.last-test-run.ndjson` is created
    And the file is parseable via `@cucumber/messages` package
    And the file contains `gherkinDocument`, `pickle`, `testCase`, `testCaseStarted`, `testStepFinished`, `testCaseFinished` envelopes

  @feature1 @AC-1.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_02 Phase 0 — per-spec NDJSON split after test run
    Given the master `.dev-pomogator/.last-test-run.ndjson` exists after a test run
    And the file contains pickles from `.specs/auth/*.feature` and `.specs/billing/*.feature`
    When the bash-post-test-ingest hook fires
    Then `.specs/auth/.test-results.ndjson` is created containing only auth-related pickles
    And `.specs/billing/.test-results.ndjson` is created containing only billing-related pickles
    And master NDJSON is preserved

  @feature2 @AC-2.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_03 SpecGraph cold start under 2 seconds for 30 specs
    Given the project contains 30 spec directories with average 10 MD files each + 3 .feature files
    When the MCP server starts cold (no SQLite cache)
    Then the SpecGraph build completes in ≤2 seconds
    And `get_trace("FR-001")` returns non-empty result immediately after

  @feature2 @AC-2.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_04 Incremental reindex under 100ms on single-file change
    Given the MCP server is running with SpecGraph populated for 30 specs
    When a single spec file `.specs/auth/FR.md` is modified
    And chokidar `change` event fires
    Then the affected subgraph is updated in ≤100ms p95
    And other specs' nodes are not re-parsed

  @feature3 @AC-3.1 @AC-3.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_05 Custom MD parser registers dual-anchor for new heading
    Given a spec file `.specs/auth/FR.md` contains heading `### FR-001: Login`
    When the MD parser indexes the file
    Then anchor `FR-001` is registered pointing to file:line
    And anchor `fr-001-login` is registered pointing to same file:line
    And wiki-link `[[FR-001]]` resolves to the heading
    And wiki-link `[[fr-001-login]]` resolves to the heading

  @feature3 @AC-3.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_06 Custom MD parser registers triple-anchor for legacy v3 heading
    Given a legacy v3 spec file `.specs/legacy/FR.md` contains `### Requirement: FR-001 Login`
    When the MD parser indexes the file with backward-compat mode
    Then anchors `FR-001`, `fr-001-login`, `requirement-fr-001-login` all resolve to the same heading
    And no migration is required for legacy spec to function

  @feature4 @AC-4.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_07 get_trace returns structured tree with natural-language explanation
    Given FR-001 exists in `.specs/auth/FR.md` with 2 ACs and 3 linked scenarios
    And SCEN-login-ok has lastResult PASSED, SCEN-login-locked has lastResult FAILED
    When agent calls MCP tool `get_trace("FR-001")`
    Then the response contains `node`, `tree.acceptance_criteria`, `tree.scenarios`, `tree.tasks`, `tree.related_nodes`
    And `explanation_for_agent` field contains FR title, counts, latest test status, failing step location
    And `explanation_for_agent` length is ≤500 characters

  @feature4 @AC-4.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_08 get_trace includes failing scenario error in explanation
    Given SCEN-login-locked has lastResult FAILED with NullReferenceException at AuthService.cs:88
    When agent calls `get_trace("FR-001")`
    Then `explanation_for_agent` mentions "SCEN-login-locked FAILED — NullReferenceException at AuthService.cs:88"

  @feature5 @AC-5.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_09 PreToolUse hook denies Write with duplicate FR-N
    Given `.specs/auth/FR.md` already contains heading `### FR-001: Login`
    When the agent attempts Write to add second `### FR-001: ...` heading
    Then PreToolUse hook returns `permissionDecision: "deny"`
    And `permissionDecisionReason` contains code `DUPLICATE_DEFINITION`
    And the reason lists both heading locations
    And the Write does not occur

  @feature5 @AC-5.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_10 PreToolUse hook denies Write with malformed YAML frontmatter
    Given the agent attempts Write to `.specs/auth/FR.md` with frontmatter missing closing `---`
    When the hook runs
    Then PreToolUse returns `permissionDecision: "deny"`
    And `permissionDecisionReason` contains code `MALFORMED_FRONTMATTER`
    And the reason includes the offending line number

  @feature5 @AC-5.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_11 PreToolUse hook denies Write with malformed Gherkin
    Given the agent attempts Write to `tests/Auth.feature` with invalid Gherkin syntax
    When the hook runs and @cucumber/gherkin parser throws
    Then PreToolUse returns `permissionDecision: "deny"`
    And `permissionDecisionReason` contains code `MALFORMED_GHERKIN`
    And the reason includes the parser error message

  @feature6 @AC-6.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_12 PostToolUse hook pushes conformance findings within 3s window
    Given the agent edits `.specs/auth/FR.md` and a conformance check produces 1 finding
    When PostToolUse hook fires
    Then within 3 seconds the agent context receives a `<system-reminder>` message
    And the message contains the finding code, location, and suggested actions

  @feature6 @feature28 @AC-6.2 @AC-28.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_13 PostToolUse hook aggregates and deduplicates findings in bulk edit
    Given the agent makes 5 sequential Edits to `.specs/auth/*.md` within 2 seconds
    When PostToolUse hook fires for each
    Then findings are batched in the 3-second throttle window
    And duplicate findings (same code + location) are deduplicated
    And only one aggregated `<system-reminder>` is pushed after the window closes
    And the push latency from the first edit is at most 3000 ms plus 100 ms tolerance

  @feature6 @AC-6.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_14 PostToolUse push silenced when frontmatter flag set
    Given a spec file frontmatter contains `_no_push_check: true`
    When the agent edits that file
    And PostToolUse hook fires
    Then no `<system-reminder>` is pushed for that file
    And the findings are still logged to `.dev-pomogator/.spec-check-log/`

  @feature7 @FR-7 @AC-7.1 @AC-7.3 @AC-7.5
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_15 Marksman native LSP registration and real link definition are verified
    Given the canonical plugin manifest declares the Marksman native LSP server
    When the Marksman native LSP registration is inspected
    Then plugin.json references `.lsp.json` through `lspServers`
    And `.lsp.json` registers server `marksman` with the launcher shim and markdown extension mapping
    And the native launcher responds to LSP `initialize` through the real Marksman binary
    And the real Marksman server resolves a Markdown link to the expected target heading

  @feature7 @AC-7.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_16 Missing Marksman disables only native markdown LSP, not spec-domain MCP tools
    Given no Marksman binary is available to the launcher
    When the native Marksman LSP launcher starts
    Then the launcher exits non-zero with an actionable missing-binary message
    And there is no custom JS markdown-LSP fallback in the MCP tool registry
    And spec-domain graph queries still work through the MCP `find_refs` tool

  @feature8 @AC-8.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_17 LLM semantic drift check detects FR↔Scenario mismatch (opt-in Phase 3)
    Given `.spec-config.json::conformance_checks.semantic_drift.enabled = true`
    And FR-001 text says "redirect to /login page on expired session"
    And SCEN-login-ok tests only API contract (no UI redirect)
    When `conformance_check(scope: "FR-001", semantic: true)` is called
    Then result includes finding code `SEMANTIC_DRIFT`
    And the finding explanation mentions the mismatch (FR mentions UI redirect, scenario tests API)
    And a Haiku subagent was spawned via `claude -p` subprocess

  @feature8 @AC-8.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_18 LLM semantic check is disabled by default
    Given `.spec-config.json::conformance_checks.semantic_drift.enabled = false` (default)
    When PostToolUse fires after spec edit
    Then only structural checks run
    And no `claude` subprocess is spawned
    And no LLM tokens are consumed

  @feature9 @AC-9.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_19 Multi-language — Reqnroll C# NDJSON ingested correctly
    Given a C# project with Reqnroll v3+ installed and dev-pomogator v4
    When `dotnet test` completes and emits `reqnroll_report.ndjson`
    Then the NDJSON ingester parses the file successfully
    And SpecGraph contains TestCase nodes with `step_bindings` pointing to `.cs:line`
    And `get_trace("FR-001")` returns code_impl references from C# source files

  @feature9 @AC-9.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_20 Multi-language — behave Python NDJSON ingested correctly
    Given a Python project with `behave` configured to emit Cucumber Messages format
    When BDD tests run and emit NDJSON
    Then v4 NDJSON ingester parses the file successfully
    And SpecGraph contains TestCase results with status PASSED/FAILED per scenario

  @feature10 @AC-10.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_21 SQLite cross-session: session B reuses session A's MCP server (Phase 4)
    Given `.spec-config.json::storage.sqlite_enabled = true`
    And session A starts MCP server and writes `.mcp-lock.json` with pid=A, env=host
    When session B starts on the same project
    Then session B detects existing lock and pid is alive
    And session B connects to session A's MCP server (no second process started)
    And both sessions see consistent SpecGraph state

  @feature10 @AC-10.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_22 SQLite cross-session: edits from session A visible in session B immediately
    Given session A and session B share an MCP server with SQLite persistence
    When session A makes a spec edit at `.specs/auth/FR.md`
    And session B calls `get_trace("FR-001")` immediately after
    Then session B sees the latest state (post-edit)
    And SQLite single-writer (`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`) ensures no race condition

  @feature10 @AC-10.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_23 SQLite corruption: auto-fallback to in-memory rebuild
    Given `.dev-pomogator/.spec-index.sqlite` file is corrupt (PRAGMA integrity_check fails)
    When the MCP server starts and opens the SQLite index
    Then corruption is detected at startup
    And the corrupt file is moved to `.dev-pomogator/.spec-index.sqlite.corrupt-{timestamp}`
    And MCP server falls back to in-memory rebuild
    And a warning is logged to `.dev-pomogator/logs/sqlite.log`

  @feature11 @AC-11.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_24 Migration helper — suggest-only mode prints diff without modifying
    Given an existing v3 project with `.specs/auth/FR.md` containing `### Requirement: FR-001 Login`
    When the user runs `dev-pomogator migrate-v3-to-v4 --suggest-only`
    Then per-file diffs are printed to stdout showing conversion to `### FR-001: Login`
    And the file is NOT modified
    And `.progress.json::version` is NOT bumped

  @feature11 @AC-11.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_25 Migration helper — interactive mode with 30s default-skip timeout
    Given the user runs `dev-pomogator migrate-v3-to-v4` (no flag)
    And the migration encounters a spec file with ambiguous structure
    When the migration prompts approve/skip/edit
    And the user provides no input for 30 seconds
    Then the default action `skip` is applied
    And the file is left unchanged
    And the migration proceeds to the next file

  @feature11
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_176 Migration helper — predict @FR-N tags for untagged scenarios
    Given a v3 spec whose FR.md defines FR-001 "User login and authentication"
    And a `.feature` with an untagged scenario "User logs in" and an already-tagged scenario
    When the user runs `dev-pomogator migrate-v3-to-v4 --suggest-only`
    Then a tag suggestion `@FR-001` is printed for the untagged "User logs in" scenario
    And the already-tagged scenario gets no suggestion
    And no tag is written into the `.feature` (advisory only)

  @feature12 @AC-12.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_26 architecture-research-workflow skill produces 7 stage outputs (Phase 6)
    Given the maintainer invokes `Skill("architecture-research-workflow")` with a feature description
    When the skill completes all 7 stages
    Then 7 stage output files are written to `.specs/{slug}/.architecture-research/`
    And files are committable (NOT in .gitignore)
    And final RESEARCH.md contains one Appendix per stage

  @feature12 @AC-12.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_27 architecture-research-workflow skill suggests rewind on new constraint
    Given Stage 4 has generated 4 architecture variants
    When the user reveals a new constraint in Stage 5 decision Q&A loop
    Then the skill suggests `restart-from-stage 4`
    And an audit-trail entry is recorded in `5-decisions-locked.md` as `[REWIND] Stage 5 → Stage 4: <reason>`
    And a 3-rewind hard limit prevents infinite loops

  @feature12 @AC-12.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_28 create-spec uses regular research-workflow for small feature (complexity heuristic)
    Given a small feature description (single file change, no architecture decisions)
    When `create-spec` runs complexity heuristic detection
    Then the heuristic does NOT match (no "архитектур"/"v\d+"/"rebuild" keywords AND <3 components)
    And `create-spec` invokes regular `Skill("research-workflow")` instead of `architecture-research-workflow`
    And 7-stage overhead is avoided

  @feature12
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_531 shared research base is the single discipline source for both research skills
    Given the shipped shared research base is loaded
    When the research skills declare their shared research discipline
    Then the base contains hypothesis-first source taxonomy triangulation verification markers schema-exhaustiveness recency anti-patterns external-pain and misconception-flush rules
    And research-workflow links the shared base and references external-pain and misconception-flush sections
    And architecture-research-workflow links the shared base from its Stage 3 broad research note

  @feature12
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_532 create-spec routes architecture research and honors research-done recursion guard
    Given create-spec Phase 1 discovery documentation is loaded
    When create-spec evaluates architectural small-feature and research-done prompts
    Then architectural prompts route to architecture-research-workflow through the real heuristic
    And small prompts route to research-workflow through the real heuristic
    And the research-done recursion guard is documented before either research skill is invoked

  @feature13 @AC-13.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_29 Orphan scenario tag returns warn-severity finding by default
    Given a `.feature` file contains `@FR-999\nScenario: Some test` and FR-999 doesn't exist
    When `conformance_check` runs
    Then result includes finding code `SCENARIO_TAG_ORPHAN`
    And severity is `warning` (default policy)
    And `suggestions[]` lists existing similar IDs (top-3 by Levenshtein distance)
    And the Write of the .feature file is NOT blocked

  @feature13 @AC-13.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_30 Orphan policy escalation to block via config
    Given `.spec-config.json::orphan_policy.scenario_tag_orphan = "block"`
    And a `.feature` file contains `@FR-999` Scenario for non-existent FR
    When `conformance_check` runs
    Then severity is `error` (escalated from default warn)
    And PostToolUse push or PreToolUse hook (depending on context) blocks the operation
    And the user is prompted to resolve before commit

  @feature14 @AC-14.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_31 Devcontainer — MCP returns relative paths in tool responses
    Given dev-pomogator v4 runs inside a VS Code devcontainer with bind-mounted workspace
    When agent calls `get_trace("FR-001")` from inside the container
    Then all file paths in response are relative to repo root
    And no absolute paths (`/workspace/...` or `D:\...`) appear in any field

  @feature14 @AC-14.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_32 Devcontainer — chokidar auto-polling fallback when events unreliable
    Given the workspace is bind-mounted from Docker Desktop on Windows
    When the MCP server starts and runs touch test
    And the touch event is not received within 500ms
    Then the chokidar watcher auto-falls-back to polling mode (1s interval)
    And the decision is logged to `.dev-pomogator/logs/watcher.log`
    And subsequent file changes are detected via polling

  @feature36 @FR-36 @AC-36.6
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_699 migration phase gate allows only complete fresh evidence
    Given a migration phase with clean qualified full evidence
    When the migration-phase gate evaluates all completion evidence
    Then the migration-phase gate returns ALLOW

  @feature36 @FR-36 @AC-36.6
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_700 migration phase gate denies dirty filtered or stale evidence
    Given a migration phase has dirty or stale evidence
    When the migration-phase gate evaluates all completion evidence
    Then the migration-phase gate returns DENY with explicit reasons

  @feature7 @FR-7 @AC-7.4
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_696 installed-versus-integrated guard rejects dead runtime changes
    Given an installed runtime change has no declared consumer
    When the installed-versus-integrated guard evaluates the change
    Then the guard denies with a missing-consumer finding and remediation

  @feature7 @FR-7 @AC-7.4
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_697 guard rejects a consumer declaration that is not truthful
    Given a runtime change claims a consumer that does not use the installed artifact
    When the installed-versus-integrated guard evaluates the change
    Then the guard denies the unverifiable consumer before accepting integration

  @feature7 @FR-7 @AC-7.4
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_698 current Marksman integration passes the real-artifact guard
    Given the current Marksman installer and launcher are changed
    When the guard runs the real installed artifact proof
    Then the guard allows integration only with a passing real-artifact result

  @feature14 @AC-14.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_33 Multi-env — second MCP start in different env is denied
    Given session A is running MCP server with `env: "host"` in `.mcp-lock.json`
    When session B tries to start MCP from inside a container on the same worktree
    Then session B detects the existing lock has different `env` tag
    And session B exits with clear message "MCP already running in env host (pid X), restart Claude Code in same env"
    And no second MCP process is spawned

  @feature15 @AC-15.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_34 Side-channel log appends JSONL entry on each finding (Phase 4)
    Given a conformance_check produces a finding `SCENARIO_TAG_ORPHAN` for SCEN-x
    When PostToolUse hook completes
    Then a JSONL line is appended to `.dev-pomogator/.spec-check-log/<YYYY-MM-DD>.jsonl`
    And the line contains `timestamp`, `finding_code`, `severity`, `location`, `message`, `spec_slug`
    And the JSONL line is valid JSON parseable line-by-line

  @feature15 @AC-15.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_35 Side-channel log rotates when size exceeds 10MB
    Given the current `.spec-check-log/<YYYY-MM-DD>.jsonl` file size is 9.5MB
    When the next append would exceed 10MB
    Then the file is rotated to `.spec-check-log/<YYYY-MM-DD>-1.jsonl`
    And a new file `.spec-check-log/<YYYY-MM-DD>-2.jsonl` starts for subsequent appends
    And previous files are not modified

  @feature16 @AC-16.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_36 Codespaces — MCP server auto-starts via postStartCommand
    Given a Codespaces environment with dev-pomogator v4 installed
    And `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` contains `postStartCommand` for MCP startup
    When the codespace starts (cold or warm)
    Then the MCP server is launched automatically
    And `.mcp-lock.json` is written with `env: "codespaces:<machine-id>"`

  @feature16 @AC-16.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_37 Codespaces — MCP server resumes after hibernation within 2s
    Given a Codespaces environment is hibernated after 30 minutes of inactivity
    When the user resumes the codespace
    Then the MCP server auto-restarts via postStartCommand
    And the SpecGraph is rebuilt from persistent `/workspaces/` files in ≤2 seconds
    And the lock file `env` tag remains `codespaces:<machine-id>`

  @feature17 @AC-17.1 @AC-17.5
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_38 Cross-spec reconcile light mode detects missing file
    Given a spec fixture `tests/fixtures/cross-spec-corpus/spec-c/` declares MCP tool `validate_user`
    And no file matching `src/mcp/validate_user*.ts` exists on disk
    When `Skill("cross-spec-reconcile", mode: "light")` is invoked with `spec_slug: spec-c`
    Then `.specs/spec-c/consistency-report.yaml` is written within 5 seconds
    And `findings[]` contains an entry with `code: "impl-drift/missing-file"`, `severity: "WARNING"`, `class: "uncovered"`
    And the finding includes `referenced_in`, `expected_path`, and `suggested_fix` fields

  @feature17 @AC-17.6
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_39 Cross-spec reconcile full mode detects runtime identifier drift
    Given fixture spec-a declares `feedback_key = "session_token"`
    And fixture spec-b declares the same concept as `sessionToken`
    When `Skill("cross-spec-reconcile", mode: "full")` is invoked
    Then `findings[]` contains an entry with `code: "cross-spec/runtime-identifier-drift"`, `severity: "CRITICAL"`
    And the finding's `spec_a` and `spec_b` fields name the two fixture specs

  @feature17 @AC-17.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_40 CRITICAL hard-conflict subset blocks STOP via CAPS prompt
    Given a lightweight reconcile run produced one CRITICAL finding from the hard-conflict subset
    When the skill reaches step 5 of execution
    Then AskUserQuestion is invoked with `header: "⚠️ CRIT"`
    And the options list includes literally «Abort STOP»
    And selecting «Abort STOP» causes the skill to exit with non-zero status

  @feature17 @AC-17.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_41 Acknowledge & override writes JSONL audit entry
    Given a CRITICAL prompt is awaiting user choice
    When the user selects «Acknowledge & override» with reason text "covered by parametrized test runner"
    Then the YAML finding gets `acknowledged_by: user`, `override_reason: "covered by parametrized test runner"`, `override_timestamp: <iso>`
    And a new line is appended to `.claude/logs/cross-spec-overrides.jsonl` with the same reason and a session_id

  @feature17 @AC-17.8
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_42 Dry-run mode skips file writes
    Given a reconcile invocation with `--dry-run` flag
    When the skill completes its checks
    Then a summary block and the first 10 findings are printed to stdout
    And neither `consistency-report.yaml` nor `consistency-report.sarif` exists on disk afterward

  @feature17 @AC-17.7
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_43 SARIF secondary output written when --sarif flag passed
    Given a reconcile invocation with `--sarif` flag against the fixture corpus
    When the skill completes
    Then `.specs/{slug}/consistency-report.sarif` exists alongside `consistency-report.yaml`
    And the SARIF `runs[0].tool.driver.rules[].id` field matches finding codes one-to-one

  @feature17
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_394 consistency-report carries a summary roll-up block
    Given a reconcile corpus with one spec that has a missing impl path
    When the consistency-report YAML is emitted for that spec
    Then the YAML carries a summary block with by_severity by_class by_namespace totals and top_3_recommendations
    And the summary totals include specs_compared and impl_paths_checked as integers
  # (SPECGEN004_43's SARIF assertion lives in its own scenario, restored below)

  @feature17
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_395 cross-spec corpus surfaces a module-ownership conflict on a shared path
    Given the cross-spec fixture corpus where spec-a and spec-b both claim src/auth/jwt.ts which exists on disk
    When cross-spec reconcile runs over the corpus
    Then findings contain a cross-spec module-ownership-conflict at CRITICAL severity

  @feature17
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_396 cross-spec corpus surfaces a contradictory NFR budget
    Given the cross-spec fixture corpus where spec-a budgets latency 100ms and spec-b budgets 50ms
    When cross-spec reconcile runs over the corpus with the NFR check enabled
    Then findings contain a cross-spec contradictory-nfr at CRITICAL severity

  @feature17 @feature18
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_397 cross-spec reconcile e2e roundtrip writes a consistency-report carrying the corpus findings
    Given the full cross-spec fixture corpus with planted drift and a shared on-disk path
    When cross-spec reconcile runs over the corpus and writes the consistency reports
    Then a consistency-report YAML is written carrying the planted finding codes from the corpus

  @feature18 @AC-18.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_44 Resolve emits 5-field explanation before any edit
    Given `.specs/{slug}/consistency-report.yaml` contains an `impl-drift/missing-file` finding
    When the user runs `/cross-spec-resolve`
    Then the skill emits an explanation block containing code+severity, files+lines, plain-language change, WHY-from-finding rationale, and option list
    And NO Edit or Write tool is invoked until the user confirms «Apply» via AskUserQuestion

  @feature18 @AC-18.5
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_45 Resolve foreign-spec edit fires additional confirm
    Given a finding's target file path begins with `.specs/spec-other/` while current resolve slug is `spec-current`
    When the resolve skill reaches the per-finding handler
    Then the explanation block includes a literal banner «⚠️ This edits foreign spec: .specs/spec-other/README.md»
    And the skill requires a second AskUserQuestion confirm distinct from the per-finding confirm

  @feature18 @AC-18.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_46 Resolve presents Path A/B/C for architectural decision
    Given a finding with `code: "impl-drift/architectural-decision-vs-reality"` and populated `path_alternatives[]`
    When resolve processes the finding
    Then AskUserQuestion is invoked with at least two Path options
    And each option's `description` field contains pros, cons, and impacted_files prose

  @feature18 @AC-18.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_47 Resolve missing report exits with hint
    Given `.specs/{slug}/consistency-report.yaml` does not exist
    When the user runs `/cross-spec-resolve`
    Then the skill exits with non-zero status
    And stdout includes literally the hint «Run /cross-spec-reconcile first»

  @feature18 @AC-18.4
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_48 Batch re-check updates resolution_status
    Given the resolve skill has processed all confirmed findings via Edit/Write
    When the skill reaches step 7 of execution
    Then `Skill("cross-spec-reconcile", mode: "full")` is invoked exactly once
    And each original finding's `resolution_status` is updated to `resolved`, `still_present`, or `transformed`
    And the YAML is written atomically via temp file + rename

  @feature18
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_284 recheckStatuses with empty fresh run marks all original findings resolved
    Given the resolve skill has original findings and the fresh reconcile run returns no findings
    When recheckStatuses is called with the original findings and an empty fresh list
    Then every original finding is classified as `resolved`
    And the result map size equals the original finding count

  @feature18
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_285 resolveCli exits 0 and emits a JSON plan when the consistency report exists
    Given a consistency-report.yaml exists for slug `demo` with one finding
    When resolveCli is called with slug `demo` and the temp repo root
    Then the exit code is 0
    And stdout parses as JSON with a `count` field and a `plan` array

  @feature18
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_286 resolveCli exits 2 when no slug is supplied
    Given the resolve CLI is invoked
    When resolveCli is called with an undefined slug
    Then the exit code is 2

  @feature19 @AC-19.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_49 Hard tier startup crash exits 1 and blocks Write
    Given `spec-conformance-guard` config file is malformed YAML
    When the agent invokes Write/Edit on any `.specs/**/*.md`
    Then the guard exits with status 1
    And stderr contains a non-empty actionable error message
    And the PreToolUse decision is deny

  @feature19 @AC-19.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_50 Hard tier file-parse crash logs to JSONL and allows Write
    Given `spec-conformance-guard` parses a `.feature` file that triggers a Gherkin parser exception
    When the agent invokes Write/Edit on that file
    Then the guard exits with status 0
    And the latest `.dev-pomogator/.spec-check-log/<YYYY-MM-DD>.jsonl` gains a new JSON line with `{timestamp, hook_id, file_path, error_message, error_stack}`
    And the PreToolUse decision is allow

  @feature22 @AC-22.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_51 Version gate skips hard guard on legacy spec
    Given a spec at `.specs/legacy-feature/` whose `.progress.json::version` is `2`
    When the agent invokes Write on `.specs/legacy-feature/FR.md` that would otherwise violate DUPLICATE_DEFINITION
    Then `spec-conformance-guard` exits with status 0
    And spec-check-log appends a JSONL entry `{kind: "ALLOW_AFTER_MIGRATION", reason: "spec_version", target: ".specs/legacy-feature/FR.md", observed_version: 2}`
    And the agent's Write proceeds

  @feature25 @AC-25.1 @AC-25.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_52 canonical plugin ships a complete static hooks.json (additive, nothing dropped)
    Given dev-pomogator v4 is distributed as a canonical plugin that ships its own static `.claude-plugin/hooks.json`
    When the plugin hook manifest is loaded
    Then `.claude-plugin/hooks.json` declares the v4 spec hooks `spec-conformance-guard`, `spec-conformance-push` and `bash-post-test/ingest`
    And it retains the pre-existing protective hook entries (the static manifest is the union, never a replacement)
    And `length(hooks.PreToolUse) >= 1` and `length(hooks.PostToolUse) >= 1`

  @feature26 @AC-26.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_53 LLM-as-judge skips deny-list match with explicit finding
    Given a spec FR body containing the substring `API_KEY=sk_live_abcdef1234567890`
    When `conformance_check(scope, semantic: true)` is invoked for that FR
    Then no `claude -p` subprocess is spawned
    And spec-check-log gains a JSON entry with `finding_code: "SEMANTIC_CHECK_SKIPPED_DENY_LIST"` and severity `INFO`
    And the caller does NOT receive a `NO_DRIFT_DETECTED` result for that FR

  @feature27 @AC-27.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_54 Marksman download sha mismatch aborts install
    Given `package.json::marksmanHashes` pins sha256 `aaaa…aaaa` for the current platform/arch/version triple
    And the actual downloaded binary's sha256 is `bbbb…bbbb`
    When `postInstall` runs the verification step
    Then install exits with non-zero status
    And the error message contains both hash values literally (`expected aaaa…aaaa`, `got bbbb…bbbb`)
    And the downloaded binary file is deleted before exit

  @feature29 @AC-29.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_55 FILE_CHANGES.md with 5 unique paths emits 5 File nodes + implements edges
    Given a spec at `tests/fixtures/specs/deep-multi-fr-refs-spec/` whose `FILE_CHANGES.md` contains 5 unique `Path` cells each citing at least one `FR-N` in the `Reason` column
    When the SpecGraph builder runs on that spec
    Then the resulting graph contains exactly 5 nodes of type `File` (one per unique path)
    And one `implements` edge is emitted per `(FR, path)` pair derived from the `Reason` citations
    And every emitted `implements` edge has `source_section = 'FILE_CHANGES'`

  @feature29 @AC-29.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_56 Glob path in FILE_CHANGES.md is skipped with single warn-once log
    Given a spec whose `FILE_CHANGES.md` contains a `Path` cell with glob pattern `tools/spec-graph/*.ts`
    When the SpecGraph builder runs on that spec
    Then no `implements` edge is emitted for that row
    And the build emits exactly one warn-once log line literally containing «glob path skipped: tools/spec-graph/*.ts»
    And the builder exits without crash with non-empty graph

  @feature29 @AC-29.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_57 DESIGN.md App-код section produces implements edge with source_section=DESIGN
    Given `DESIGN.md` "App-код" section lists `src/foo.ts`
    And FR-3 body in `FR.md` cites `src/foo.ts`
    When the SpecGraph builder runs on that spec
    Then the graph contains an `implements` edge from `FR-3` to `File("src/foo.ts")`
    And the edge's `source_section` equals literally `'DESIGN'`

  @feature29
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_58 Empty FILE_CHANGES.md table emits zero edges and zero File nodes
    Given a spec at `tests/fixtures/specs/minimal-spec/` whose `FILE_CHANGES.md` contains only the table header with no data rows
    When the SpecGraph builder runs on that spec
    Then the resulting graph contains zero nodes of type `File`
    And the resulting graph contains zero edges of type `implements`
    And the build exits without crash

  @feature29
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_59 Duplicate path across FILE_CHANGES.md and DESIGN.md is deduplicated to one File node
    Given `FILE_CHANGES.md` cites `src/foo.ts` in FR-1's row
    And `DESIGN.md` "App-код" section also lists `src/foo.ts` for FR-1
    When the SpecGraph builder runs on that spec
    Then the graph contains exactly one `File` node with path `src/foo.ts`
    And the graph contains exactly one `implements` edge from `FR-1` to `File("src/foo.ts")`
    And the edge's `source_section` equals literally `'FILE_CHANGES'` (precedence over DESIGN)

  @feature30 @AC-30.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_60 get_trace on FR with 3 implements edges returns code_impl array of length 3
    Given a spec where `FR-5` has 3 `implements` edges to files `src/a.ts`, `src/b.ts`, `src/c.ts`
    When the MCP client invokes `get_trace({node_id: "FR-5"})`
    Then the response field `code_impl` is an array of length 3
    And each entry contains both `file_path` and `source_section` keys with non-empty string values

  @feature30 @AC-30.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_61 AC node inherits code_impl from parent FR
    Given a spec where `FR-5` has 2 `implements` edges to files `src/a.ts`, `src/b.ts`
    And `AC-5.1` has no direct `implements` edges
    When the MCP client invokes `get_trace({node_id: "AC-5.1"})`
    Then the response field `code_impl` is an array of length 2
    And the entries equal parent `FR-5`'s `code_impl` entries identically by `file_path`

  @feature30
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_62 Scenario node code_impl unions all tagged FRs' code_impl
    Given a `.feature` Scenario tagged with both `@FR-1` and `@FR-2`
    And `FR-1` has 1 `implements` edge to `src/x.ts`
    And `FR-2` has 1 `implements` edge to `src/y.ts`
    When the MCP client invokes `get_trace({node_id: "SCENARIO-id"})`
    Then the response field `code_impl` is an array of length 2 containing both `src/x.ts` and `src/y.ts` exactly once each

  @feature30
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_63 Node with no implements edges returns code_impl as empty array
    Given a spec where `FR-7` has zero `implements` edges
    When the MCP client invokes `get_trace({node_id: "FR-7"})`
    Then the response field `code_impl` is present and equals literally `[]`
    And the field is NOT omitted from the JSON response

  @feature30
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_64 Malformed implements edge in graph produces actionable error from get_trace
    Given the SpecGraph contains an `implements` edge with missing `file_path` field
    When the MCP client invokes `get_trace({node_id: "FR-5"})`
    Then the response includes a top-level `warnings[]` array
    And `warnings[]` contains an entry with `code = "MALFORMED_IMPLEMENTS_EDGE"` and the offending edge's source location

  Scenario: SPECGEN004_65 Reqnroll NDJSON fixture roundtrips through detectRunner + parseNdjson + builder
    Given the fixture `tests/fixtures/reqnroll-sample/output.ndjson` exists alongside its `README.md`
    When `detectRunner` is invoked on the fixture file
    Then `detectRunner` returns literally `'reqnroll'`
    And `parseNdjson` produces a `TestResultPatch` containing at least 2 scenarios
    And at least one scenario has `status = 'PASSED'` and at least one has `status = 'FAILED'`

  @feature31
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_66 behave NDJSON fixture roundtrips and get_test_result matches per-language statuses
    Given the fixture `tests/fixtures/behave-sample/output.ndjson` exists alongside its `README.md`
    When the test ingests the fixture into the SpecGraph builder
    And invokes MCP `get_trace({node_id: <fixture_fr>})`
    Then the returned `scenarios[].lastResult` matches the expected per-language statuses
    And invoking `get_test_result({scenario_id: <same>})` returns the same statuses

  @feature31
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_67 JVM (cucumber-jvm) NDJSON fixture roundtrip
    Given the fixture `tests/fixtures/jvm-sample/output.ndjson` exists alongside its `README.md`
    When `detectRunner` is invoked on the fixture file

  @feature31
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_68 Unknown runner NDJSON falls back to cucumber-js parser with warn
    Given an NDJSON file with envelopes that match no known runner signature
    When `detectRunner` is invoked on that file
    Then `detectRunner` returns literally `'cucumber-js'` (default fallback)
    And stderr contains literally «runner detection fell back to cucumber-js»

  @feature31
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_69 Multi-language fixture missing README.md errors loudly with actionable hint
    Given `tests/fixtures/reqnroll-sample/output.ndjson` exists but `tests/fixtures/reqnroll-sample/README.md` is absent
    When the fixture-shapes test suite runs
    Then the test fails with non-zero exit status
    And the error message contains literally «fixture missing README.md: tests/fixtures/reqnroll-sample/»
    And the hint includes literally «document exact runner command + version»

  @feature31 @AC-31.2
  Scenario Outline: SPECGEN004_377 real-builder roundtrip -- buildGraph surfaces per-scenario lastResult and failingStep error for <runner> fixture
    Given the multilang roundtrip fixture directory `<fixture-dir>` with featureUri `<feature-uri>` frId `<fr-id>` frTitle `<fr-title>`
    When the multilang roundtrip materialises the fixture into a tmpdir and calls buildGraph with featureRoots override
    Then the SpecGraph contains a `<qualified-fr-id>` FR node and scenario nodes for `<expected-passed>` and `<expected-failed>`
    And MCP get_trace of `<qualified-fr-id>` returns lastResult PASSED for `<expected-passed>` and FAILED for `<expected-failed>`
    And MCP get_test_result of `<expected-failed>` returns lastResult FAILED
    And the multilang roundtrip FAILED scenario `<expected-failed>` carries a non-empty failingStep errorMessage

    Examples:
      | runner       | fixture-dir     | feature-uri                                 | fr-id | fr-title           | qualified-fr-id | expected-passed           | expected-failed                |

      | Cucumber-JVM | jvm-sample      | src/test/resources/features/payment.feature | FR-3  | Payment processing | jvm:FR-3        | SCEN-charge-succeeds      | SCEN-insufficient-funds        |

  @feature32 @AC-32.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_70 spec-status derives DONE only when all mapped scenarios PASSED
    Given a task whose Done-When references scenarios that are all `PASSED` in the latest `.last-test-run.ndjson`
    When `spec-status -Format task-table` computes the task's status
    Then the rendered status is `DONE`
    And no `TASK_STATUS_UNVERIFIED` finding is emitted for that task

  @feature32 @AC-32.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_71 honesty gate flags hand-set DONE whose scenario is undefined
    Given a task hand-set to `Status: DONE` whose mapped scenario is `UNDEFINED` in the latest run
    When `spec-status` computes the verified status
    Then a finding `TASK_STATUS_UNVERIFIED` is emitted with the offending scenario id and bucket
    And the rendered status is capped at `IN_PROGRESS`, never `DONE`

  @feature32 @AC-32.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_72 get_spec_status (view coverage) returns per-scenario buckets matching the run
    Given a `.last-test-run.ndjson` with a mix of passed, pending, undefined and ambiguous scenarios
    When the MCP client invokes `get_spec_status(view: coverage)`
    Then the response groups every scenario into exactly one of `passed`, `pending`, `undefined`, `ambiguous` or `failed`
    And the per-bucket counts equal the cucumber summary for the same run

  @feature32
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_73 get_spec_status (view coverage) returns per-task verified status
    Given a spec whose tasks map to scenarios of mixed result
    When the MCP client invokes `get_spec_status(view: coverage)`
    Then each task carries a `verified_status` of `DONE` only if all its mapped scenarios are `passed`
    And tasks with any non-passed mapped scenario carry `verified_status` of `in_progress`

  @feature32
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_74 get_trace surfaces verified_status per node
    Given a SpecGraph built from a spec with a recorded test run
    When the MCP client invokes `get_trace({node_id: <task or FR>})`
    Then the node includes a `verified_status` field derived from coverage
    And it never reports `DONE` while a linked scenario is pending, undefined or ambiguous

  @feature33 @AC-33.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_75 orchestrator delegates to a worker instead of reimplementing it
    Given the orchestrator reaches the coverage step of the workflow
    When it computes per-scenario coverage
    Then it invokes the `get_spec_status` MCP tool (or the coverage worker skill)
    And the orchestrator skill body contains no re-implementation of the bucketing logic

  @feature33 @AC-33.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_76 friction during a run appends a pending ledger entry without touching spec or code
    Given the orchestrator detects a gap during a run
    When it records the observation
    Then a dated entry with `status = "pending"` is appended to `.specs/spec-generator-v4/SELF_IMPROVE.md`
    And no spec or code file is modified as a result of that entry

  @feature33 @AC-33.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_77 session start reminds the human of pending ledger entries
    Given `SELF_IMPROVE.md` contains at least one entry with `status = "pending"`
    When the orchestrator starts a session
    Then it surfaces a reminder containing the pending count
    And the reminder lists the top pending entries' observations

  @feature33 @AC-33.4
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_78 approved entry is auto-applied; pending is never auto-applied
    Given a ledger entry marked `status = "approved"` by the human
    When the orchestrator processes the ledger
    Then it may auto-apply the entry and sets its `status = "applied"` with an applied-at date
    And any entry still `status = "pending"` is left unapplied

  @feature33 @AC-33.5
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_79 drift guard fails when a capability is unreferenced by the feature-map
    Given a new MCP tool exists that the orchestrator feature-map does not reference
    When the drift guard runs
    Then it fails with a non-zero status
    And the message names the unreferenced capability

  @feature34 @AC-34.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_80 anchor-integrity reports same-file and cross-file broken anchors with the likely heading
    Given a heading slug changed, orphaning one same-file and one cross-file inbound anchor
    When the anchor-integrity check runs over the spec files
    Then both broken links are reported with their file, line and unresolved anchor
    And each one names the heading slug the link most likely meant

  @feature34 @AC-34.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_81 marksmanSlug matches the Marksman golden fixture and is the single shared source
    Given the captured Marksman golden slug fixture
    When marksmanSlug is computed for every id-shape in the fixture
    Then each result equals the slug the real Marksman binary produced
    And both the SpecGraph md parser and the specs-generator core import that one marksmanSlug function

  @feature34
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_82 a Write that orphans an anchor triggers a reminder and the Stop-gate escape is bounded
    Given a spec file edited so an inbound anchor no longer resolves
    When the PostToolUse anchor hook inspects the edited file
    Then it returns a system-reminder naming the broken link and its fix
    And the Stop-gate honours a skip-anchor-fix escape only when the reason is at least 8 characters

  @feature34 @AC-34.4
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_83 the deterministic fixer repairs an id-bearing link without an LLM and is idempotent
    Given a broken link whose text carries the heading id
    When the deterministic fixer runs over the spec
    Then it rewrites the anchor to the heading's current marksmanSlug without invoking any model
    And applying the fixer a second time changes nothing

  @feature34 @AC-34.5
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_84 an ambiguous link is dispatched to claude in the background, never guess-rewritten
    Given a broken link whose text identifies no heading id
    When the headless fallback runs with the claude binary available
    Then it dispatches a background claude process for that link without blocking
    And with the claude binary unavailable the link stays flagged and is never rewritten

  @feature35 @AC-35.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_85 a fake-positive green test cannot mark a task DONE
    Given a task whose linked scenario is GREEN but whose test body audits as FAKE-POSITIVE-RISK
    When the honesty derivation runs with the test-quality verdict
    Then verified_status is capped below DONE
    And a TASK_TEST_QUALITY finding names the task and the fake-positive verdict

  @feature35 @AC-35.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_86 a genuinely strong green test is not false-blocked
    Given a task whose linked scenario is GREEN and whose test body audits as STRONG
    When the honesty derivation runs with the test-quality verdict
    Then verified_status is DONE

  @feature35 @AC-35.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_87 the orchestrator feature-map carries an enforced test-quality stage
    Given the orchestrator feature-map
    When the drift guard evaluates it
    Then a test-quality stage exists between coverage and honesty-gate routing to strong-tests and spec-status
    And the drift guard fails when that stage is removed

  @feature35 @AC-35.4
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_88 the pre-DONE Stop-gate blocks a done claim on a weak test
    Given a session-touched task whose test audits as WEAK
    When the pre-DONE Stop-gate runs
    Then it blocks the done claim
    And it allows the claim only with an audited skip-test-quality escape logged to .claude/logs

  @feature35 @AC-35.5
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_89 a task marked DONE with zero linked scenarios is not silent
    Given a task marked DONE with no linked scenario at all
    When checkConformance runs
    Then it emits a finding naming the task
    And the returned finding set is not empty

  @feature35
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_142 the test-quality producer joins per-test verdicts to the backing task worst-wins
    Given a task backed by a scenario with two graded tests one WEAK one FAKE-POSITIVE-RISK
    When the test-quality producer joins the per-test verdicts
    Then the task verdict is the worst of the two and a task with no graded test is absent

  @feature35
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_137 the test-quality side-channel file caps a green DONE task on the read surfaces
    Given a side-channel test-quality file recording a WEAK verdict for a green DONE task
    When the honesty read surfaces load the side-channel file
    Then the verdict read from the file caps the task below DONE
    And with no side-channel file present the same green task reads DONE

  @FR-44
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_140 a task that references no requirement is flagged (reverse traceability)
    Given a task with empty refs whose Done-When names no requirement
    When checkConformance runs for reverse traceability
    Then a TASK_NO_REQUIREMENT info finding names the task

  @FR-44 @AC-44.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_141 a project test with no spec scenario is flagged as an orphan project test
    Given a project test file with one id that has a spec scenario and one that does not
    When the project-test reverse trace runs
    Then only the test id with no scenario is reported as an orphan project test

  @FR-44 @AC-44.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_144 an FR citing no research finding is flagged only when the spec has a research file
    Given two specs where only one has a research file and each has an FR without a research citation
    When the FR-to-research reverse trace runs
    Then only the uncited FR of the spec with the research file is flagged and a citing FR is not

  @FR-44
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_145 upstream stories use-cases and decisions wired to no requirement are flagged
    Given a spec whose story and use-case and decision variously cite or omit a requirement
    When the upstream reverse trace runs
    Then only the unlinked story use-case and research-less decision are flagged with their kinds

  @feature36 @AC-36.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_90 two specs defining the same bare id produce two distinct nodes
    Given two specs that each define the bare id FR-2
    When the builder assembles the graph with composite keys
    Then the graph holds a node keyed slug-A:FR-2 and a node keyed slug-B:FR-2
    And neither node is collision-dropped

  @feature36 @AC-36.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_91 an intra-file anchor stays bare and file-local
    Given a markdown link FR.md#fr-2 inside one spec
    When the anchor index resolves it
    Then the anchor alias is the bare form fr-2 not the composite key
    And Marksman and anchor-fix are unaffected

  @feature36 @AC-36.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_92 get_trace returns scenarios via real edges
    Given a covers and tested-by edge built with composite keys on both ends
    And a same-spec featureN to FR-N tested-by edge
    When get_trace runs on an FR that has BDD scenarios
    Then it returns those scenarios via real graph edges
    And it no longer relies on the tag-scan workaround

  @feature36 @AC-36.4
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_93 a colliding bare id returns the candidate list
    Given a bare id FR-2 that collides across specs
    When a tool is called with that bare id
    Then it returns the candidate list of slug:id entries
    And it does not return one arbitrary node

  @feature36 @AC-36.7
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_94 a qualified id resolves the exact node
    Given a graph keyed by composite ids
    When a tool is called with slug:FR-2 or with spec and node_id
    Then it resolves the exact node for that spec

  @feature36 @AC-36.5
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_95 the dogfood harness shows zero collisions after migration
    Given the migration phase has completed
    When the dogfood harness dumps the raw pre-map nodes
    Then there are zero id collisions
    And the FR-node count is about 470 not 47

  @feature37 @AC-37.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_96 a bare structural pass is not reportable as clean
    Given validate-spec returns zero structural errors but the smart analysis has open findings
    When spec health is reported
    Then the verdict is the smart analysis over the one graph
    And a bare validate-spec zero-errors is not reportable as valid or clean or done

  @feature37 @AC-37.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_97 a stale FILE_CHANGES path fails the verdict
    Given a FILE_CHANGES path that does not exist on disk
    When the authoritative verdict runs
    Then it fails with a hard error naming the stale path

  @feature37
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_98 an untraced atom fails the traceability gate
    Given an UNCOVERED_FR or a TASK_UNTESTED or an UNTAGGED_SCENARIO exists
    When the authoritative verdict runs
    Then it fails with a per-item gap list
    And within spec-generator-v4 these must be zero for a green verdict

  @feature37 @AC-37.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_99 the semantic check runs in the verdict path
    Given a claude binary is present
    When the authoritative verdict runs
    Then the FR-8 semantic drift check runs as part of it

  @feature37
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_100 a missing semantic binary fails loud not silent
    Given no claude binary is available
    When the authoritative verdict runs
    Then it carries a SEMANTIC_SKIPPED note
    And it never reports no drift detected for unchecked content

  @feature37 @AC-37.4
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_101 a skill may not launder a structural pass
    Given a skill or agent reports spec health
    When it produces its verdict
    Then it surfaces the smart verdict and gap list
    And it does not state valid or clean or done off validate-spec alone

  @feature38 @AC-38.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_102 a docs-only spec reads SPEC_ONLY
    Given a spec with FR and AC docs but zero scenarios
    When get_spec_status runs for that spec
    Then the lifecycle is SPEC_ONLY and last_run is null

  @feature38 @AC-38.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_103 written-but-never-run tests read TESTS_NOT_RUN
    Given a spec whose scenarios carry no last result
    When get_spec_status runs for that spec
    Then the lifecycle is TESTS_NOT_RUN and last_run is null

  @feature38 @AC-38.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_104 a failing run reads RED with the linked summary
    Given a spec whose last run holds a failed scenario
    When get_spec_status runs for that spec
    Then the lifecycle is RED
    And the last_run summary counts the failure and identifies the run

  @feature38 @AC-38.4
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_105 an all-passed run reads GREEN with the linked summary
    Given a spec whose last run passed every scenario
    When get_spec_status runs for that spec
    Then the lifecycle is GREEN
    And the last_run summary counts the passes and identifies the run

  @feature38 @AC-38.5
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_106 undefined steps read PARTIAL never GREEN
    Given a spec whose last run has undefined scenarios and zero failures
    When get_spec_status runs for that spec
    Then the lifecycle is PARTIAL
    And the response carries counts gaps and an agent hint

  @feature21 @AC-21.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_107 task-table CLI output byte-matches the frozen contract baseline
    Given the frozen task-table input spec fixture
    When spec-status runs with the task-table format on it
    Then the output byte-matches the committed task-table baseline
    And a second run produces identical bytes without any MCP server

  @feature24 @AC-24.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_108 meta-guard denies removing a protected registration from a v4 manifest
    Given a canonical hooks manifest carrying the spec-conformance-guard registration
    When an agent write removes that registration
    Then the meta-guard denies the write naming spec-conformance-guard
    And removing the meta-guard own registration is denied too

  @feature20 @AC-20.1 @AC-59.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_109 conformance summary is threshold-only and acknowledged via spec-status
    Given an isolated conformance state with zero unresolved events
    Then the prompt-time summary emits nothing
    When two deny findings land in the hard-tier log
    Then the prompt-time summary is a single unresolved-DENY line
    When the spec-status ack stamps the state file
    Then the prompt-time summary is silent until a newer deny arrives

  @feature20 @FR-20 @AC-20.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_695 summary stays fast and ack writes remain whole JSON
    Given a conformance state with 1000 recent deny entries and an isolated acknowledgement file
    When the real summary producer is measured over 100 samples and the ack command runs
    Then the p95 summary time is at most 50 milliseconds
    And every acknowledgement read is valid complete JSON
    And no temporary acknowledgement file remains

  @feature20
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_152 the task census surfaces unfinished tasks in the prompt banner
    Given a spec corpus with one open task and one done task
    When the conformance-push producer runs over it
    Then the banner surfaces the open task count from the cached census

  @feature36
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_110 parser slices merge through one ingest path with first-writer-wins identity
    Given two markdown files in one spec defining the same FR id
    When the builder assembles the graph from both
    Then exactly one node carries that composite id and it is the first parsed
    And gherkin slices deduplicate through the same ingest semantics

  @FR-39 @AC-39.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_111 agent file access to specs is denied in enforce mode and logged
    Given spec access enforcement is enabled after read and write sufficiency are proven
    When the agent calls a file tool on a path under the specs tree
    Then the call is denied with a pointer to the MCP tools
    And the violation lands in the spec-access audit log

  @FR-39
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_112 shadow mode logs spec-access violations without blocking
    Given the spec-access guard runs in shadow mode
    When the agent reads a spec file directly
    Then the access is logged as a violation
    And the call is not blocked

  @FR-39 @AC-39.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_113 read_spec_doc serves whole documents with an audit trail
    Given a spec document whose prose lives outside graph nodes
    When the agent calls read_spec_doc for it
    Then the full document content is returned
    And the read lands in the spec-access audit log

  @FR-40 @AC-40.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_114 apply_spec_change rejects invalid writes before touching disk
    Given a spec change that breaks an anchor or a form contract
    When the agent applies it through the MCP mutation tool
    Then the server refuses without writing and returns the findings list
    And the corrected change is written atomically and logged

  @FR-40
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_553 mutation validation gates only debt introduced by the candidate edit
    Given an existing spec with staged FR-47 and task-truth debt
    When the agent applies an unrelated clean edit and then introduces a new unlinked FR
    Then pre-existing debt is ignored but the newly introduced conformance debt is refused

  @FR-40
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_560 form validation is monotonic and explains the complete recovery contract
    Given a legacy TASKS document with repeated pre-existing form debt
    When the agent shifts legacy lines, edits valid prose, and then adds one malformed task through apply_spec_change
    Then unchanged legacy form debt does not block either clean edit
    But the net-new malformed task is refused with the complete TASKS form contract and transaction recovery hint
    And USER_STORIES and DESIGN refusals expose their exact heading field and list contracts

  @FR-40 @AC-40.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_115 a successful MCP write refreshes the graph for the next read
    Given an accepted spec change written through MCP
    When the agent reads the affected node afterwards
    Then the response reflects the fresh state

  @FR-40
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_116 create_spec births a verdict-green spec through MCP
    Given the create_spec mutation tool
    When the agent creates a new spec through it
    Then the authoritative verdict for the newborn spec is NOT_READY

  @FR-40
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_139 the mutation door writes a subdir working doc but refuses a traversal write
    Given a spec that needs a research stage file written into a subdirectory
    When the agent applies a subdir write and a traversal write through the mutation tool
    Then the subdir doc is written without the graph gates and the traversal write is refused with nothing escaping the spec root

  @FR-40
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_147 the delete door removes a free doc but refuses a referenced doc and single-writer artifacts
    Given a spec with a free prose doc and a doc whose nodes are referenced from another file
    When the agent deletes each target through the delete door
    Then the free doc is deleted and the referenced doc and the progress artifact are refused with named blockers

  @FR-41 @AC-41.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_117 each creation phase runs in a dedicated headless agent
    Given the phase agent definitions with MCP-only allowed-tools
    When the orchestrator runs a creation phase
    Then the phase executes in its dedicated headless agent
    And the agent has no direct file tools over specs

  @FR-41
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_118 the orchestrator gates phase transitions on a green verdict
    Given a completed creation phase with open verdict gaps
    When the orchestrator checks the phase gate
    Then the phase returns to its agent with the gap list
    And the next phase starts only after the gate is GREEN

  @FR-41 @AC-41.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_119 agent spawns and gate decisions are observable in the log
    Given an orchestrated spec creation run
    When phases spawn retry and pass their gates
    Then every spawn retry and gate decision is logged with agent and phase identity

  @FR-42 @AC-42.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_120 every user-facing MCP tool has a skill consumer and the drift guard names strays
    Given the MCP tool to skill consumer table in the design
    When a new user-facing MCP tool ships without a skill consumer
    Then the extended drift guard fails naming that tool

  @FR-42 @AC-42.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_121 the user still enters through a skill and the skill drives MCP
    Given the create-spec skill as the user entry point
    When the user asks to create a spec
    Then the skill orchestrates the phases through MCP calls
    And the skill body re-implements none of the server logic

  @FR-42
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_146 every migrated authoring skill declares the MCP door in its allowed-tools
    Given the list of authoring skills migrated to MCP-rails
    When each migrated skill's frontmatter is inspected
    Then every one of them declares dev-pomogator-specs door tools in allowed-tools

  @FR-23 @AC-23.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_122 the two-tier log inventory writes each tier to its own sink
    Given a soft-tier event and a hard-tier finding
    When each is logged through its canonical writer
    Then the soft event lands in the global form-guards log
    And the hard finding lands in the repo spec-check-log JSONL created on first write

  @FR-28
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_123 the push throttle window is fixed and never slides
    Given findings accumulating in bursts within one throttle window
    When more findings arrive before the window elapses
    Then the window start stays the original one
    And the flush after the window carries the aggregated deduplicated set

  @FR-40
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_124 apply_spec_change refuses a traversal slug (no write outside .specs)
    Given a mutation targeting a spec slug that escapes the specs tree
    When the agent applies it
    Then the server refuses on the target guard
    And no file is written outside the specs tree

  Scenario: SPECGEN004_125 a mixed-case doc extension is refused (no case-insensitive overwrite)
    Given an existing validated FR.md and a change targeting FR.MD
    When the agent applies it
    Then the server refuses on the target guard
    And the original FR.md content is intact

  @FR-40
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_126 .progress.json is not an agent-mutable document
    Given a change targeting .progress.json
    When the agent applies it
    Then the server refuses on the target guard
    And no progress file is written

  @FR-40
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_127 an empty full-replace of a non-empty doc is refused
    Given an existing non-empty document and an empty-content change
    When the agent applies it
    Then the server refuses on the change guard
    And the document keeps its content

  @FR-40
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_128 supplying both content and an edit pair is ambiguous and refused
    Given a change carrying both content and an old_string/new_string pair
    When the agent applies it
    Then the server refuses as ambiguous

  @FR-40
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_129 a change to a non-existent spec returns a clean not-found, not a crash
    Given a markdown change targeting a spec slug that does not exist
    When the agent applies it
    Then the server returns a clean validation failure without throwing

  @FR-40
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_130 create_spec refuses a Windows reserved device-name slug
    Given a create_spec call with a reserved device-name slug
    When the agent runs it

  @FR-40
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_131 an edit is not blocked by pre-existing broken anchors in sibling docs
    Given a scaffolded spec with placeholder anchors in a sibling document
    When the agent applies a clean change to another document
    Then the change is accepted despite the sibling's pre-existing broken anchors
    But a broken anchor introduced by the change itself is still refused

  @FR-39
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_132 read tools refuse a traversal slug (no out-of-tree leak)
    Given a secret file outside the specs tree and a read targeting it via a traversal slug
    When the agent calls the read tool
    Then the read is refused as an unsafe spec and nothing outside the tree is returned

  @FR-39
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_148 the git VCS-plumbing carve-out lets door-written specs be committed but not content-leaked
    Given the spec-access-guard git carve-out under enforce
    When git plumbing and git content commands run over the specs tree
    Then VCS plumbing commands are allowed and content-reading git commands stay violations

  @feature14 @AC-14.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_149 every session's door stays writable — a second session's write serialises in (no lifetime read-only)
    Given a spec corpus whose presence-lock is already held by another session
    When a second session boots its door and exercises read + write tools
    Then every session can write — the second session's write serialises in, reads stay live, and no lifetime lock refuses it

  @feature49 @AC-49.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_160 a backlog-marked spec is excluded from the task-census the Stop-gate reads
    Given a spec corpus with two specs each carrying one open task
    When I mark spec demo-b backlog through the set_spec_status door tool
    Then the door reports backlog and the task-census drops demo-b while demo-a stays

  @feature49
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_161 marking a spec active again restores it to the task-census
    Given a spec corpus with two specs each carrying one open task
    When I mark spec demo-b backlog then back to active through the door
    Then the marker is removed and the task-census counts demo-b again

  @FR-39
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_150 read_spec_doc paginates a big doc by section, by line window, and whole
    Given a spec doc with several headings and many lines
    When the agent reads it by section, by line window, and whole
    Then each paging mode returns the right slice with total_lines metadata

  @FR-40
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_153 optimistic CAS refuses a stale write and the rebased write lands
    Given a spec doc read with its content sha
    When the agent applies with the fresh sha, then the stale sha, then the rebased sha
    Then only the up-to-date write lands and the stale one is refused CAS_MISMATCH

  @FR-39
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_151 the inline skip-spec-access marker lets one Bash spec read through under enforce
    Given the spec-access-guard inline escape under enforce
    When a Bash spec read runs with a valid marker, no marker, and a too-short marker
    Then only the valid marker is honoured and the escape is audit-logged

    Then every engine CLI is allowed and the generic reader stays a violation

  @FR-39
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_505 the grep-pattern carve-out allows a stream or pattern-scoped search that merely mentions the specs path
    Given the spec-access-guard grep-pattern carve-out
    When a pattern-position grep, a piped stream grep, and a path-operand grep all run over the specs path text
    Then only the path-operand grep stays a violation and the pattern-position and piped forms are allowed

  @FR-32
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_143 get_spec_status (view coverage) scopes to one spec while a bare call stays corpus-wide
    Given a graph holding scenarios from two different specs
    When get_spec_status (view coverage) is called scoped to one spec and then bare
    Then the scoped buckets hold only that spec's scenarios and the bare buckets hold the whole corpus

  @FR-32

  Scenario: SPECGEN004_154 the deterministic FR census never false-greens an FR with open tasks
    Given a fixture corpus where one FR has a done task and an open task and another FR is marked done with no passing scenario
    When the deterministic fr-census runs over the built graph
    Then the FR with an open task reads IN_PROGRESS not IMPLEMENTED
    And the FR marked done with no test reads DONE_UNTESTED in the false-green list
    And every FR appears exactly once and the per-verdict counts conserve
    And the census classifies every FR of the live spec-generator-v4 corpus by graph evidence

  @FR-40
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_155 rename_spec_doc refuses to strand inbound links, then retargets them on opt-in
    Given a spec doc with inbound markdown links from another doc
    When the agent renames it through the door without rewrite_inbound
    Then the door refuses with a Decision block naming the inbound links and nothing is moved
    When the agent renames it again with rewrite_inbound
    Then the doc is moved, the old name is gone, and the inbound links are retargeted to the new name

  @FR-43 @AC-43.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_156 legacy-triage suspects a superseded feature without auto-retiring it
    Given a v4 spec holding an old-version feature file and a plain not-run feature
    When the legacy-triage classifier runs over the graph
    Then the old-version feature is suspected SUPERSEDED with its lineage evidence
    And the plain not-run feature is not flagged (not_run alone is not abandonment)
    And nothing is retired automatically

  @FR-45 @AC-45.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_157 get_archival_proof keeps a spec still referenced by a live spec
    Given a graph where one spec is referenced by an edge from a live spec

  @feature47
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_169 fr-census is web-complete only with ALL six legs (AND, not OR)
    Given a graph with a fully-legged FR and a sibling FR missing only its research leg
    When fr-census computes the completeness verdict
    Then the fully-legged FR is web-complete and the other FR misses only research

  @feature48
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_171 the lifecycle machine accepts legal transitions and rejects illegal ones
    Given the task-lifecycle transition table
    When a status transition is checked
    Then todo to ready to in-progress to done and the done to in-progress reopen are legal but todo straight to done is rejected

  Scenario: SPECGEN004_174 set_entity_status refuses an unbacked or illegal transition and writes a valid one
    Given a graph and the set_entity_status tool
    When a status change is requested for a task
    Then an illegal transition or an unassembled chain is refused with the reason and a valid transition writes through the door

  @feature48
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_175 set_entity_status refuses a derived entity and returns its computed verdict
    Given a graph with an FR and the set_entity_status tool
    When a status change is requested for that FR
    Then the change is refused as STATUS_DERIVED and the reply carries the FR census verdict

  @feature48 @AC-48.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_452 a phase STOP is confirmed through the door only past the ordering gate
    Given a temp spec whose Discovery STOP is not yet confirmed
    When phase status changes are requested through set_entity_status
    Then confirming the Requirements STOP first is refused for the unconfirmed prior STOP, a task-vocab status on a phase is illegal-for-type, and confirming the Discovery STOP writes stopConfirmed through the canonical writer

  @feature48
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_177 get_spec_status publishes the settable phase ids
    Given a temp spec with a known phase STOP state
    When get_spec_status reports the phase list for that spec
    Then its phases list carries the slug-qualified phase id and the stop-confirmed flag matching the progress file

  @feature48
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_180 set_entity_status resolves a bare local task id (+ optional spec), not only the composite slug:id
    Given a graph and the set_entity_status tool
    When a status change is requested by bare local task id

  Scenario: SPECGEN004_478 discovery-forms executable evals exercise real form contracts
    Given the discovery-forms executable eval runner
    When that form-skill eval runner executes
    Then the eval aggregate is fully green and every case exercised the real form contracts

  @feature58 @AC-58.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_479 requirements-chk-matrix executable evals pin invalid CHK IDs
    Given the requirements-chk-matrix executable eval runner
    When that form-skill eval runner executes
    Then the eval aggregate is fully green and every case exercised the real form contracts
    And the eval aggregate pins the P16-1 negative regression cases

  @feature58 @AC-58.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_570 task-board-forms executable evals pin lowercase task markers
    Given the task-board-forms executable eval runner
    When that form-skill eval runner executes
    Then the eval aggregate is fully green and every case exercised the real form contracts
    And the eval aggregate pins the P16-1 negative regression cases

  @feature57
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_508 scaffold template ownership keeps non-scaffold templates out of the base templates directory
    Given the real scaffold template mapping and owning skill reference template directories
    When the spec-generator template ownership check runs
    Then every template left in tools/specs-generator/templates is instantiated by scaffold-spec
    And the seven non-scaffold templates live only under their owning skill reference templates

  @feature34
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_509 feature template FR tags resolve against FR template headings
    Given the real feature and FR scaffold templates
    When the feature-template anchor integrity check runs
    Then every feature-template @FR tag resolves to an FR heading in FR.md.template

  @feature37
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_510 audit split-responsibility documentation separates mechanical and semantic work
    Given the Phase 3 audit overview and audit split-responsibility references
    When the audit split-responsibility documentation is checked
    Then mechanical audit categories are declared as script-owned inputs not AI rediscovery work
    And semantic-only audit categories are declared as agent-owned review work
    And the spec health rule points "is it healthy?" to the composed verdict only

  @feature40
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_511 progress state has an engine-only two-writer contract
    Given a temp spec corpus for the progress writer contract
    When scaffold-spec creates a fresh spec and spec-status repairs a pre-existing spec
    Then scaffold-spec is the bootstrap writer for initial .progress.json state
    And spec-status is the state-transition writer for existing specs
    And create-spec documentation forbids manual or MCP mutation of .progress.json while naming both engine writers

  @feature35
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_512 active spec unconfirmed STOP is loud without corpus-wide nagging
    Given a temp spec corpus with active and legacy specs that both have unconfirmed STOPs
    When the specs-validator prompt hook receives a prompt about the active spec
    Then the hook output surfaces the active spec unconfirmed STOP with the exact confirm command
    And the hook output does not emit a corpus-wide unconfirmed STOP count
    And the unrelated legacy spec stays quiet unless verbose mode is enabled

  @feature59 @AC-59.1 @AC-59.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_513 PostToolUse conformance push keeps Claude reminder bounded while retaining the full log
    Given a PostToolUse push window with 3000 conformance findings
    When the spec-conformance push window flushes
    Then the emitted reminder is at most 6000 bytes
    And the emitted reminder summarizes the finding count, severity counts, omitted count, and full-log pointer
    And the emitted reminder shows no more than 20 sample findings
    And the durable spec-check-log writer still records every synthetic finding

  @feature52 @AC-52.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_514 validate_anchor distinguishes compact aliases from Marksman heading slugs
    Given a validate_anchor tool over a spec containing a punctuation-heavy Marksman heading
    When validate_anchor checks both a compact id and DOC.md#heading-slug
    Then the tool description separates the alias registry from Marksman heading slugs
    And the compact id and Marksman heading slug resolve while a non-Marksman slug does not

  @feature52
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_515 anchor-fix repairs enforce sessions through the spec door
    Given a spec with a broken id-bearing anchor while spec-access enforce is on
    When anchor-fix runs in door mode
    Then the anchor is fixed through the spec door and enforce hints never prescribe a raw write

  @feature52
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_517 FILE_CHANGES v1 layout drift is specific to canonical plugin repos
    Given a canonical plugin repo fixture with FILE_CHANGES edit rows under removed v1 prefixes
    When the spec-reality checker runs on the v1 layout drift fixture
    Then it emits FC_V1_LAYOUT_DRIFT instead of generic FC_EDIT_MISSING
    And the same missing src edit path stays generic when the src directory exists

  @feature52
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_519 TASK_NO_OWN_SCENARIO accepts migrated many-to-few consolidation with a green covering scenario
    Given a graph with a DONE migrated task mapped to one passing consolidated scenario and one not-run sibling
    When conformance runs over the graph
    Then no TASK_NO_OWN_SCENARIO finding is raised for that task
    And a TASK_STATUS_UNVERIFIED warning still surfaces the not-run sibling

  # ── FR-56: scenario-result overlay freshness (P29) ───────────────────────────

  @feature56 @AC-56.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_529 every BDD run path writes append-only scenario overlay rows
    Given a Cucumber message run for a focused FR-56 scenario
    When the scenario-result overlay writer records that run
    Then the scenario overlay contains one row with result, run identity, source, and trace id
    And appending another run preserves the existing overlay row

  @feature56 @AC-56.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_534 scenario trace lookup returns the archived failing step
    Given a Cucumber message run for a failed FR-56 scenario
    When the scenario trace tool reads that archived run through the graph
    Then the scenario trace response contains the failing step, error text, and run identity
    And an expired scenario trace returns a rerun hint instead of throwing

  @feature49
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_530 inherited prose stays non-authoritative while an owned task may arm Pinator
    Given a Pinator-fix mandate with terse prose both without and with an owned task
    When the real Stop hook sends that turn to the judge
    Then prose alone is inactive while the owned task supplies the only work authority

  # ── FR-60: high-level MCP authoring API (pending implementation) ─────────────

  @feature60 @AC-60.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_520 section-targeted append preserves validation and EOL style
    Given a spec document has an existing Phase heading and a known EOL style
    When an agent proposes an MCP append_to_section operation targeting that Phase heading
    Then the proposal resolves the stable heading anchor without requiring an exact old_string
    And the preview preserves the document EOL style
    And the same form, anchor, and conformance checks run before any write is applied

  @feature60 @AC-60.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_521 read_for_edit returns section metadata and safe insertion tokens
    Given an agent reads a spec section for edit through the MCP door
    When the read_for_edit response is returned
    Then it includes eol_style, heading_anchor, section_sha, start_line, end_line, and append or insert tokens
    And a follow-up insert using those tokens targets the same section even when unrelated document text changes elsewhere

  @feature60 @AC-60.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_522 replacement diagnostics distinguish EOL whitespace multi-match and missing-anchor misses
    Given an MCP literal replacement fails to find old_string in a spec document
    When the server analyzes the failed replacement
    Then the response classifies the miss as EOL-only, whitespace-only, multi-match, changed body under the same anchor, or missing anchor
    And with normalize_eol true a CRLF/LF-only mismatch is accepted while the persisted file keeps its original EOL style

  @feature60 @AC-60.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_523 multi-document proposal previews graph impact and applies atomically
    Given a proposed spec change spans FR.md, ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md, TASKS.md, the feature file, and FILE_CHANGES.md
    When the agent calls propose_patch and then apply_spec_transaction
    Then the preview includes anchors found, a diff, affected graph nodes, conformance findings, resulting shas, and a proposal_id
    And applying the proposal writes all documents atomically or leaves every document unchanged
    And the audit log records the transaction as one conceptual spec mutation
    And the active create-spec workflow exposes and routes cross-document bootstrap through all transaction tools

  @feature60 @AC-60.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_524 anchor-targeted CAS mismatch auto-rebases only non-conflicting changes
    Given an anchor-targeted MCP mutation was prepared from an older document sha
    When another session has changed unrelated text outside the target anchor
    Then the mutation auto-rebases and applies against the fresh document
    But when the target anchor body or preconditions changed the server refuses with fresh anchor context for the caller

  @feature60 @AC-60.4
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_525 domain helpers render canonical traceable markdown and enforce feature safety
    Given an agent registers incident-driven backlog or amends a requirement through a domain helper
    When the helper renders FR, AC, TASK, and optional feature changes
    Then the generated markdown follows the canonical form contracts and keeps FR to AC to TASK traceability links
    And ids are unique within the affected spec documents
    And executable feature scenarios are refused unless matching step-definition work is included or the caller explicitly selects a TASKS-only acceptance pin

  # ── FR-61: unified readiness UX (pending implementation) ────────────────────

  @feature61 @AC-61.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_539 spec verdict separates structural health from readiness
    Given a spec is structurally valid and traceable but has unrun scenarios and DONE-but-unverified tasks
    When spec-verdict summarizes that spec
    Then the output shows STRUCTURE, TRACEABILITY, EXECUTION, TASK_TRUTH, BDD_SYNC, SEMANTIC, and FILTERED_PROOF lanes
    And the final readiness label is OVERALL NOT_READY and the canonical verdict is NOT_READY

  @feature61 @AC-61.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_540 MCP status and verdict use aligned gap semantics
    Given an FR has traceability edges but no canonical passed execution evidence
    When get_spec_status and spec-verdict report the spec
    Then execution absence is reported as SCENARIO_NOT_RUN or FR_NOT_EXECUTION_VERIFIED
    And the same condition is not reported as UNCOVERED_FR

  @feature61 @AC-61.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_541 task DONE truth guard downgrades evidence-missing work
    Given a task is textually marked DONE with an unchecked Done When item or a mapped scenario that is not canonical PASSED
    When the status mutation door and verdict evaluate that task
    Then the DONE status is denied or downgraded to evidence-derived IN_PROGRESS
    And the missing scenario or checklist evidence is named to the agent

  @feature61 @AC-61.4
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_542 source and executable BDD scenarios stay synchronized
    Given a source spec feature and an executable tests/features feature disagree on scenario ids, FR tags, or scenario count prose
    When the BDD sync checker runs
    Then executable-only scenarios require EXEC_ONLY or OUT_OF_SCOPE markers
    And source-only scenarios require an explicit pending marker or executable counterpart

  @feature61 @AC-61.5
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_543 filtered Docker BDD proof is visible without poisoning canonical coverage
    Given a filtered Docker BDD run passes selected scenario ids for a spec
    When MCP status or spec-verdict reports coverage evidence
    Then canonical coverage remains unchanged until a full run or accepted attachment lands
    And a FILTERED_PROOF lane shows the artifact path, selected ids, pass/fail summary, timestamp, source, and next action

  @feature62 @FR-62 @AC-62.1 @AC-62.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_573 inherited, closed, and noninteractive stdin root handoff is deterministic
    Given a real fixture checkout has equivalent Windows and WSL roots and tracked readiness inputs
    And SPECS_GENERATOR_ROOT is supplied as an environment override while stdin is independently inherited, closed, or noninteractive
    When spec-status and MCP resolve the root in order through validated SPECS_GENERATOR_ROOT, caller or project cwd, and findRepoRoot(SCRIPT_DIR)
    Then neither command waits indefinitely for stdin or reads the root from stdin
    And valid SPECS_GENERATOR_ROOT selects the same tracked artifact set as the caller project fallback

  @feature62 @FR-62 @AC-62.2 @AC-62.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_554 WSL-only root precheck accepts only caller or project WSL roots
    Given a WSL-only command resolves its candidate root from the caller or project WSL worktree
    When the root precheck runs through CLI and MCP
    Then each surface accepts only a validated caller or project WSL root
    And it reports NOT_READY with the observed root, unsafe artifact, and corrective action without substituting a plugin-cache, C Windows cwd, or UNC-relative root

  @feature63 @FR-63 @AC-63.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_555 precheck MCP and verdict derive one FR AC scenario inventory
    Given a real fixture has graph-mapped FRs, ACs, scenarios, baseline and run identities, and duplicate inventory candidates
    When precheck, MCP status, and spec-verdict evaluate the fixture
    Then each surface reports the same deduplicated FR, AC, and scenario inventory with mandatory readiness lanes
    And a structural-only result remains NOT_READY

  @feature63 @FR-63 @AC-63.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_556 full-run evidence preserves source time recency and outcome taxonomy
    Given a BDD run has source, timestamp, recency, baseline, run identity, and PASSED, UNKNOWN, not_recorded, stale, or filtered evidence states
    When the readiness evaluator serializes graph evidence
    Then each state remains explicit and no source, time, or recency field is discarded
    And filtered proof cannot replace canonical full-run execution evidence

  @feature63 @FR-63 @AC-63.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_557 AC readiness exposes empty test paths and never-run FR taxonomy requires every mandatory lane
    Given mapped AC ids include an AC with test_paths=[] and a never-run FR and readiness lanes have mixed pass and missing evidence
    When the FR-61 readiness taxonomy evaluates the candidate
    Then the result exposes the AC ids, test_paths=[], and explicit never-run classification while AND-gating every mandatory lane
    And it reports the next action without treating dependency-absent evidence as source-tree success or dependency-absent FR-64 evidence as FR-63 success

  @feature64 @FR-64 @AC-64.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_558 graph conformance classifies source spec test generated temp smoke and silent evidence
    Given a real spec fixture contains source, spec-test, generated, temporary, smoke, unclassified, and silent evidence records
    When graph conformance and release inventory run with baseline evidence sha `0b291bac`
    Then canonical records retain explicit provenance, intentional classification, traceability edges, and baseline evidence sha `0b291bac`
    And unclassified or silent inventory evidence is surfaced and cleaned rather than accepted as implementation proof

  @feature64 @FR-64 @AC-64.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_559 Docker-only verification records current pre and post release inventory
    Given a real Docker BDD fixture has classified and cleaned tracked before and after inventories, including temporary and untracked paths, and PASSED, FAILED, PENDING, UNDEFINED, AMBIGUOUS, and NOT_RUN units
    When /run-tests runs the Docker-only release inventory gate
    Then every tracked in-scope unit must be PASSED, every outcome remains distinct, and every in-scope unit satisfies the AND gate
    And additions, removals, duplicates, and untracked paths are explicitly classified; unclassified untracked paths violate cardinality or conservation rather than becoming release-ready

  @feature64 @FR-64 @AC-64.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_574 dependency-absent launcher status and MCP remain provenance-safe
    Given an installed plugin fixture has repository development dependencies absent
    When the installed launcher, status surface, and MCP execute the fixture
    Then a missing runtime import, bundle, or asset is reported with installed-runtime provenance and does not become a source-tree pass
    And a complete installed fixture records its baseline, run identity, and evidence source

  @feature64 @FR-64 @AC-64.4
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_561 release evidence controls one candidate through integration-first verification
    Given a single PR, GitHub release candidate, or tag is prepared with README, TASKS, CHANGELOG, and release notes
    When integration-first verification or post-release monitoring detects a tracked-file or dependency-absent failure after release
    Then the PR identity, GitHub release candidate, or tag, run identity, owner, monitoring signal, rollback action, and follow-up verification are recorded
    And not_recorded or never-run evidence prevents a release-ready claim

  @feature39 @FR-39
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_562 the installed spec guard preserves structured denies and catches whole-tree Git mutations
    Given the canonical hook-service dispatches the real spec-access guard through the bootstrap runner
    When direct spec access, Git message data, and whole-tree Git mutations run with spec-access enforce on
    Then direct access and whole-tree mutations are structured denies without a runner failure reason while Git message data is allowed

  @feature34 @FR-34 @AC-34.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_563 parallel sessions attribute only their own staged and unstaged spec changes
    Given two sessions share a Git worktree with pre-existing dirty spec debt and independent anchor provenance baselines
    When each session touches a different dirty spec and one file has both staged and unstaged changes
    Then each anchor Stop-gate classifies only its own touched spec without mutating the Git index
    And a session without reliable baseline evidence reports provenance unknown and fails open

  @feature39 @FR-39 @AC-39.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_564 spec access enforcement defaults on and hook launchers resolve without plugin root
    Given the spec guard environment precedence and canonical command-hook launchers
    When enforcement signals and a launcher without CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT are exercised
    Then the first parseable signal wins, unset signals default to enforce, explicit false disables, and every launcher resolves absolutely

  @feature65 @FR-65 @AC-65.1 @AC-65.2 @AC-65.3 @AC-65.4
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_565 paid deployed API acceptance maps to implementation test and semantic evidence
    Given a synthetic paid SPA corpus with shallow, blocked-investigation, and complete acceptance task plans
    When the real acceptance delivery analyzer and audit inspect every plan
    Then shallow coverage names every missing public contract paid flow and semantic deploy lane
    And a blocking investigation remains red while the complete AC-linked plan passes
    And empty task plans exact AC identifiers alternate claim wording and analyzer outages fail closed

  @feature61 @feature63 @AC-61.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_566 MCP status derives EXECUTION and OVERALL from the shared effective inventory
    Given a spec whose canonical full-run pass became stale after a source change
    When MCP status and spec-verdict evaluate the same graph snapshot
    Then both surfaces report the stale scenario as effective execution debt
    And both surfaces report EXECUTION RED and OVERALL NOT_READY
    And canonical coverage remains visible without overriding effective readiness
    And dotted acceptance criterion ids remain exact in the spec-status parser

  @feature56 @FR-56 @AC-56.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_575 overlay evidence is commit-bound and backward-compatible
    Given legacy and commit-bound scenario overlay rows for the same scenarios
    When the real overlay reader evaluates them against the current commit
    Then the matching commit pass is fresh and the legacy or mismatched pass is stale
    And the trace response exposes commit provenance and the persisted failing step

  @feature56 @FR-56 @AC-56.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_576 overlay compaction preserves each latest scenario result
    Given an overlay file with repeated rows for multiple scenarios
    When the real overlay compactor rewrites the file
    Then one latest row per scenario remains and distinct-scenario cardinality is conserved
    And the canonical full-run artifact remains byte-identical

  @feature56 @FR-56
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_577 the overlay writer compacts each archived run so the trail stays bounded
    Given a cucumber-messages archive that reports the same scenarios on every run
    When the real overlay writer archives three runs with compaction enabled
    Then the overlay holds exactly one row per scenario regardless of run count

  @feature32
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_544 get_spec_status keeps a mixed-result FR execution-unverified
    Given a requirement whose linked scenarios are passed, failed and not run
    When the MCP client invokes get_spec_status view coverage for the mixed requirement
    Then FR_NOT_EXECUTION_VERIFIED includes the requirement until every linked scenario has passed

  @feature16
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_538 form-authoring steer inspects full-document edits inside MCP transactions
    Given a multi-document spec transaction with a full TASKS form and a targeted FR edit
    When the transaction is evaluated by spec-authoring-steer
    Then the full TASKS edit is routed to task-board-forms while targeted edits remain allowed

  @feature32 @FR-32
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_544 FR execution verification requires every linked scenario to pass
    Given a requirement whose linked scenarios are passed, failed and not run
    When the MCP client invokes get_spec_status view coverage for the mixed requirement
    Then FR_NOT_EXECUTION_VERIFIED includes the requirement until every linked scenario has passed

  @feature39 @FR-39
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_538 full-content transaction edits cannot bypass form-skill steering
    Given a multi-document spec transaction with a full TASKS form and a targeted FR edit
    When the transaction is evaluated by spec-authoring-steer
    Then the full TASKS edit is routed to task-board-forms while targeted edits remain allowed

  @FR-10
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_545 SQLite schema mismatch quarantines the stale cache before warm-start
    Given an opt-in SQLite graph cache stamped with an obsolete schema version
    When the MCP lifecycle opens the SQLite cache with recovery
    Then the stale cache is quarantined with reason schema_mismatch
    And a fresh cache uses the current schema and contains no stale nodes

  @FR-10
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_546 SQLite lifecycle warm-start restores the persisted graph
    Given an opt-in SQLite lifecycle builds and persists a spec graph
    When a second MCP lifecycle starts over the unchanged repository
    Then the second lifecycle reports a warm cache and serves the persisted nodes


  @FR-36 @feature36
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_577 canonical namespace and localId round-trip preserves exact identity
    Given a hierarchical namespace identity with an exact local ID
    When the canonical identity is formatted and parsed
    Then the exact namespace local ID and canonical ID are preserved

  @FR-36 @feature36 @AC-36.8
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_578 ambiguous local ID returns every canonical namespace candidate
    Given two namespaces that each define local ID FR-3
    When get_node receives the bare local ID FR-3
    Then the ambiguity response includes local ID and sorted canonical candidates

  @FR-36 @feature36 @AC-36.9
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_579 case-only identity variants collide inside one namespace
    Given two canonical IDs in one namespace that differ only by case
    Then the identity contract reports a CASE_NORMALIZED collision

  @FR-36 @feature36
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_580 Unicode NFKC identity variants collide inside one namespace
    Given two canonical IDs in one namespace that are Unicode NFKC equivalents
    Then the identity contract reports a UNICODE_NORMALIZED collision

  @FR-36 @feature36
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_581 case-equivalent local IDs remain legal across namespaces
    Given case-equivalent local IDs in different canonical namespaces
    Then the identity contract reports no cross-namespace collision

  @FR-36 @feature36
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_582 the real corpus has no normalization identity collisions
    Given the migration phase has completed
    When the dogfood harness dumps the raw pre-map nodes
    Then the collision probe reports zero normalization collisions


  @FR-66 @feature66 @AC-66.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_583 typed metadata preserves known and unknown fields
    Given an FR with valid typed requirement metadata and an extension field
    When the real graph parses and serves the requirement
    Then typed metadata and the unknown extension round-trip exactly

  @FR-66 @feature66 @AC-66.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_584 invalid metadata fails consistently across parser and MCP
    Given an FR with invalid safety and demand metadata
    When parser and MCP authoring validate the metadata
    Then both surfaces return the same metadata validation findings

  @FR-66 @feature66 @AC-66.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_585 missing required delivery blocks smart overall only
    Given an implemented FR with one required delivery artifact missing
    When the real FR census evaluates task and delivery truth
    Then task verdict stays IMPLEMENTED and delivery is INCOMPLETE

  @FR-66 @feature66 @AC-66.4
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_586 all required delivery artifacts satisfy non-empty ALL
    Given an implemented FR with every required artifact present
    When the real FR census evaluates task and delivery truth
    Then delivery is DELIVERED and optional missing artifacts do not block

  @FR-66 @feature66 @AC-66.5
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_587 forwarded delivery demands resolve precedence and conflicts
    Given linked requirements with inherited duplicate and contradictory demands
    When the delivery resolver forwards needs through the graph
    Then demands deduplicate and contradictions emit FR_DEMAND_CONFLICT

  @FR-66 @feature66 @AC-66.6
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_588 metadata migration query and SQLite restore agree
    Given legacy requirement metadata with an unknown extension
    When migration MCP query and SQLite warm restore process it
    Then every surface returns the same typed metadata and delivery state


  @feature67 @FR-67 @AC-67.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_589 edge vocabulary has exhaustive endpoint rules
    Given a graph fixture with every supported edge type
    When I inspect the typed edge endpoint schema
    Then verifies and entitles are distinct edge types with endpoint rules
    And every edge type has exactly one endpoint rule

  @feature67 @FR-67 @AC-67.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_590 valid semantic edge directions pass validation
    Given a graph fixture with valid covers tested-by verifies and entitles edges
    When I validate all graph edge endpoints
    Then no endpoint violations are reported
    And all valid semantic edges remain traversable

  @feature67 @FR-67 @AC-67.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_591 invalid edge endpoints fail with actionable detail
    Given a graph fixture with an AC to FR covers edge
    When I validate all graph edge endpoints
    Then an ENDPOINT_VIOLATION error identifies actual and allowed endpoint types
    And the invalid edge is retained for diagnosis

  @feature67 @FR-67 @AC-67.4
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_592 MCP staged transaction refuses invalid endpoints atomically
    Given a staged MCP spec graph and a candidate graph with an injected invalid typed edge
    When I run the MCP transaction endpoint gate on before and after graphs
    Then the gate reports a new ENDPOINT_VIOLATION and refuses the write
    And every transaction document remains byte-identical

  @feature67 @FR-67 @AC-67.5
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_593 SQLite restore preserves typed edges and verdict
    Given a graph with verifies entitles and endpoint metadata
    When I persist and restore the graph through SQLite
    Then the restored typed edges and metadata equal the cold graph
    And cold and warm endpoint verdicts are identical

  @feature67 @FR-67 @AC-67.6
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_594 existing edge producers remain compatible
    Given markdown gherkin implementation result and trace edge fixtures
    When I build and validate the composite graph
    Then existing covers tested-by implementation result and trace edges are valid
    And MCP trace traversal still returns existing and new semantic edges


  @feature67 @FR-67 @AC-67.7
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_595 real producers auto-emit verifies and entitles edges
    Given a spec fixture with a decision requirement line and a passing tagged scenario
    When I build the graph and derive verifies from the passing result
    Then the markdown producer emits an entitles edge from the decision to its requirement
    And the builder emits a verifies edge from the passing scenario carrying producer and version



  @feature68 @FR-68 @AC-68.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_596 uncovered acceptance criterion is a blocking error
    Given a graph fixture with an AC that has no own tested-by scenario
    When I evaluate completion evidence conformance
    Then UNCOVERED_AC is reported as an error for that exact criterion

  @feature68 @FR-68 @AC-68.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_597 unverified acceptance criterion is a blocking error
    Given an AC with own scenarios but no current passing verifies edge
    When I evaluate completion evidence conformance
    Then UNVERIFIED_AC is reported as an error for that exact criterion

  @feature68 @FR-68 @AC-68.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_598 parent requirement evidence does not complete sibling criteria
    Given two sibling ACs whose parent FR has a passing scenario
    And only the first AC has its own passing scenario
    When I build the readiness inventory
    Then the first AC is satisfied and the second has inherited non-completing context

  @feature68 @FR-68 @AC-68.4
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_599 AC satisfaction is non-empty ALL
    Given multiple ACs with one satisfied criterion and one open criterion
    When I evaluate mandatory readiness lanes
    Then AC_SATISFACTION is RED until every criterion has own passing evidence

  @feature68 @FR-68 @AC-68.5
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_600 bulk criterion tag laundering is rejected
    Given sibling AC tags copied across scenarios without distinct behavioral assertions
    When I evaluate tag bulk suspicion
    Then blocking TAG_BULK_SUSPECT is emitted and copied tags are not counted as proof

  @feature69 @FR-69 @AC-69.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_601 NFR nodes and evidence survive readiness inventory
    Given a required NFR with its own tagged and passing scenario
    When I build the spec-scoped readiness inventory
    Then the NFR and its tested-by and verifies edges remain in the inventory

  @feature69 @FR-69 @AC-69.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_602 uncovered and unverified NFRs are blocking
    Given one required NFR with no scenario and another with no passing scenario
    When I evaluate completion evidence conformance
    Then UNCOVERED_NFR and UNVERIFIED_NFR are reported as errors

  @feature69 @FR-69 @AC-69.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_603 NFR satisfaction is required non-empty ALL
    Given required optional and justified not-applicable NFRs
    When I evaluate mandatory readiness lanes
    Then NFR_SATISFACTION depends on every required NFR and keeps the others visible

  @feature69 @FR-69 @AC-69.4
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_604 NFR verification methods persist across all surfaces
    Given NFR fixtures using test analysis review inspection and demonstration methods
    When I round-trip them through parser MCP query and SQLite restore
    Then every surface returns the same method and evaluated evidence state

  @feature70 @FR-70 @AC-70.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_605 evidence node has a typed endpoint contract
    Given a requirement and a valid content-addressed evidence manifest
    When I build and validate the graph
    Then an Evidence node and evidenced-by edge are present with valid endpoints

  @feature70 @FR-70 @AC-70.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_606 evidence manifest preserves provenance and integrity fields
    Given a complete artifact manifest with identity timing digest and subject fields
    When I parse persist restore and query its Evidence node
    Then all manifest fields remain byte-equivalent across surfaces

  @feature70 @FR-70 @AC-70.3
  Scenario Outline: SPECGEN004_607 invalid artifact evidence never becomes present
    Given required operational proof with an artifact that is <invalidity>
    When I derive its evidence state
    Then the evidence is MISSING and the smart verdict is not GREEN

    Examples:
      | invalidity |
      | missing |
      | non-regular |
      | empty |
      | outside the attachment root |
      | digest-mismatched |
      | not finalized |
      | stale for the subject revision |

  @feature70 @FR-70 @AC-70.4
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_608 demonstration and inspection imply operational proof
    Given requirements whose verification methods are demonstration inspection and test
    When I normalize their delivery demands
    Then demonstration and inspection require operational proof and test does not gain it implicitly

  @feature70 @FR-70 @AC-70.5
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_609 manual present and dead evidence targets are rejected
    Given operational proof with hand-authored PRESENT or a non-present evidence target
    When I validate and evaluate the demand
    Then manual PRESENT is invalid and target existence alone cannot satisfy the demand

  @feature70 @FR-70 @AC-70.6
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_610 evidence survives graph MCP transaction and SQLite restore
    Given a valid Evidence node edge manifest and review fixture
    When I use full and incremental builds staged MCP transactions and SQLite cold-warm restore
    Then identity endpoint validation fields and verdict are equivalent on every path

  @feature71 @FR-71 @AC-71.1
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_611 demonstration recording is finalized before review
    Given a live target exercise with a video recorder
    When the producer closes the recording and registers its manifest
    Then hashing and judge review begin only after the artifact is finalized

  @feature71 @FR-71 @AC-71.2
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_612 independent reviewer binds the exact artifact digest
    Given a finalized demonstration with distinct producer and reviewer identities
    When the reviewer evaluates the artifact
    Then the review records both identities and the exact reviewed digest

  @feature71 @FR-71 @AC-71.3
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_613 judge verdict is complete and timestamped
    Given a demonstration with multiple required criteria
    When the independent judge emits its structured verdict
    Then every criterion has a timestamped observation and CONFIRMED or DENIED outcome

  @feature71 @FR-71 @AC-71.4
  Scenario Outline: SPECGEN004_614 invalid independent review never completes proof
    Given required demonstration proof whose review is <invalidity>
    When I evaluate independent judgment
    Then operational proof remains incomplete and the smart verdict is not GREEN

    Examples:
      | invalidity |
      | reviewer equals producer |
      | producer identity absent |
      | reviewer identity absent |
      | bound to a different digest |
      | missing a required criterion |
      | contains a required DENIED outcome |
      | unavailable |

  @feature71 @FR-71 @AC-71.5
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_615 protocol dogfoods its own independently reviewed MP4
    Given the FR-71 live producer-to-judge walkthrough has been recorded
    When an independent judge reviews that exact MP4 against every AC-71 criterion
    Then the evidence manifest and CONFIRMED verdict satisfy FR-71 demonstration proof



@feature72 @FR-72 @AC-72.1
Scenario: SPECGEN004_616 Canonical parsing retains task contract
  Given a strict task declares identity, revision, typed links, criteria, surfaces, artifacts, and evidence policy
  When the execution planner parses it
  Then the query returns every declared canonical field

@feature72 @FR-72 @AC-72.2
Scenario: SPECGEN004_617 Canonical READY task round-trips losslessly
  Given a canonical READY task with ordered dependencies and criteria
  When it is parsed rendered and parsed again

@feature72 @FR-72 @AC-72.5
Scenario: SPECGEN004_620 Invalid task apply is atomic
  Given a persisted canonical task snapshot

@feature73 @FR-73 @AC-73.1
Scenario: SPECGEN004_621 Typed dependency retains reason
  Given task A depends-on task B because schema generation must finish
  When graph builds dependencies

@feature73 @FR-73 @AC-73.2
Scenario: SPECGEN004_622 Cycle proposal is refused
  Given A depends-on B and B depends-on C
  When dry-run proposes C depends-on A
  Then response names cycle and DAG remains unchanged

@feature73 @FR-73 @AC-73.3
Scenario: SPECGEN004_623 Blocker explanation names predecessor
  Given task A depends-on incomplete B for contract publication
  When task A is planned
  Then A shows B relation reason and state as blocker

@feature73 @FR-73 @AC-73.4
Scenario: SPECGEN004_624 Prose ordering cannot make task ready
  Given task A says after B in prose and task C has unfinished typed predecessor
  When readiness is evaluated
  Then A gets migration warning and C is not READY

@feature73 @FR-73 @AC-73.5
Scenario: SPECGEN004_625 Dependency graph restores deterministically
  Given a valid typed DAG from TASKS.md
  When source incremental and SQLite paths load it
  Then ordered edges and reverse blockers match

@feature74 @FR-74 @AC-74.1
Scenario: SPECGEN004_626 Surface claim is structured
  Given a task declares file write locator scope and rationale
  When validation runs
  Then permitted kind access normalized locator scope and rationale persist

@feature74 @FR-74 @AC-74.2
Scenario: SPECGEN004_627 Unsafe locators are flagged
  Given task claims ../outside.ts and an unbounded glob
  When planner validates surfaces
  Then named redacted finding for traversal, absolute/UNC, normalization, realpath symlink/junction, or bounded-glob breach prevents safe scheduling without command execution

@feature74 @FR-74 @AC-74.3
Scenario: SPECGEN004_628 Actual artifacts reconcile with plan
  Given task declares only src/planner.ts
  When execution records src/planner.ts and config/runtime.json
  Then report identifies undeclared actual artifact

@feature74 @FR-74 @AC-74.4
Scenario: SPECGEN004_629 Impact query shows paths
  Given a task writes schema consumed by two dependent tasks
  When MCP queries blast radius
  Then direct claim and transitive tasks include explanations

@feature74 @FR-74 @AC-74.5
Scenario: SPECGEN004_630 Nonlocal locator is never executed
  Given a task declares shell-like external-contract locator
  When planner validates it
  Then boundary remains typed data without command execution

@feature75 @FR-75 @AC-75.1
Scenario: SPECGEN004_631 Access overlap derives conflicts
  Given ready tasks with write/write read/write and exclusive overlap
  When conflicts are derived
  Then each unsafe pair has applicable class

@feature75 @FR-75 @AC-75.2
Scenario: SPECGEN004_632 Semantic resource conflicts across files
  Given two tasks edit different files but write API contract billing.v2
  When conflicts are derived
  Then semantic API conflict is returned

@feature75 @FR-75 @AC-75.3
Scenario: SPECGEN004_633 Conflict explanation is inspectable
  Given two tasks conflict on normalized schema
  When MCP queries conflict
  Then tasks claims overlap and derivation rule are shown

@feature75 @FR-75 @AC-75.4
Scenario: SPECGEN004_634 Override expires
  Given scoped audited conflict override with expiry
  When time advances past expiry
  Then it no longer suppresses conflict and audit remains visible

@feature75 @FR-75 @AC-75.5
Scenario: SPECGEN004_635 Batches never forge dependency
  Given two ready tasks conflict in a wave
  When batches are planned
  Then they separate without adding DAG edge

@feature76 @FR-76 @AC-76.1
Scenario: SPECGEN004_636 Selected DAG yields parallel waves
  Given A precedes B and C is independent
  When selected subgraph is planned
  Then A and C occur before B in labelled waves

@feature76 @FR-76 @AC-76.2
Scenario: SPECGEN004_637 Wave batches are conflict free
  Given a wave has two conflicting tasks and one independent task
  When planner partitions it
  Then each batch is conflict free and union equals wave

@feature76 @FR-76 @AC-76.3
Scenario: SPECGEN004_638 Critical path uses estimates
  Given acyclic graph with estimates and one documented default
  When metrics calculate
  Then weighted critical path slack and default marker return

@feature76 @FR-76 @AC-76.4
Scenario: SPECGEN004_639 Blocked task reveals schedule impact
  Given blocked task lies on critical path
  When plan reports schedule
  Then blocker reason and affected downstream path are shown

@feature76 @FR-76 @AC-76.5
Scenario: SPECGEN004_640 Identical input gives identical plan
  Given unchanged selected graph with equal candidates
  When cold and warm planning run
  Then stable-key JSON for waves, batches, critical path, slack, normalized-ID tie order, and half-up estimate rounding is byte-equivalent and warm p95 meets the 300-task/450-edge/1500-claim harness budget

@feature77 @FR-77 @AC-77.1
Scenario: SPECGEN004_641 Evidence is task owned
  Given a validation run owns scenario and artifact evidence
  When evidence stores
  Then owner validated IDs run environment result and fingerprints persist

@feature77 @FR-77 @AC-77.2
Scenario: SPECGEN004_642 Input change closes stale descendants
  Given B consumes artifact from A and C depends on B
  When A fingerprint changes
  Then B and C become stale with paths and reasons

@feature77 @FR-77 @AC-77.3
Scenario: SPECGEN004_643 Historical proof cannot complete stale task
  Given successful evidence becomes stale
  When lifecycle recovers task
  Then history stays visible and task is not DONE before READY or in-progress

@feature77 @FR-77 @AC-77.4
Scenario: SPECGEN004_644 Filtered success is not full proof
  Given evidence policy requires full suite
  When only filtered passing run attaches
  Then run remains visible and task is not DONE

@feature77 @FR-77 @AC-77.5
Scenario: SPECGEN004_645 Evidence survives restoration
  Given current historical evidence and stale reasons
  When graph persists restores and MCP queries
  Then ownership result fingerprints and reasons agree

@feature78 @FR-78 @AC-78.1
Scenario: SPECGEN004_646 Discovery proposes instead of mutating
  Given discovery finds candidate child task
  When it finishes
  Then schema-valid proposal returns and graph waits for apply

@feature78 @FR-78 @AC-78.2
Scenario: SPECGEN004_647 Discovery identities and budgets are bounded
  Given stable semantic key and child scope write limits
  When proposal exceeds limit
  Then child ID derives from parent key and excess is rejected

@feature78 @FR-78 @AC-78.3
Scenario: SPECGEN004_648 Discovery replay is idempotent
  Given accepted discovery output digest
  When same output replays
  Then no-op returns without duplicate task or edge

@feature78 @FR-78 @AC-78.4
Scenario: SPECGEN004_649 Discovery patch is atomic
  Given patch has valid child and cyclic dependency
  When dry-run and apply run
  Then both report cycle and persist no patch part

@feature78 @FR-78 @AC-78.5
Scenario: SPECGEN004_650 Empty and high impact discovery are controlled
  Given one discovery is empty and another is high impact
  When proposals evaluate
  Then first records no_children and second awaits approval

@feature79 @FR-79 @AC-79.1
Scenario: SPECGEN004_651 MCP query explains plan
  Given selected graph has dependencies surfaces conflicts and stale evidence
  When agent queries execution plan
  Then typed graph impact conflicts waves batches path slack stale reasons and explanations return

@feature79 @FR-79 @AC-79.2
Scenario: SPECGEN004_652 Mutation honors dry-run CAS atomicity
  Given graph revision and patch with invalid change
  When dry-run and CAS apply request
  Then dry-run writes nothing and apply leaves all records unchanged

@feature79 @FR-79 @AC-79.3
Scenario: SPECGEN004_653 SQLite preserves planning truth
  Given canonical tasks claims evidence and plan persist
  When cold and warm restore occur
  Then model edges plan stale state and reports are equivalent

@feature79 @FR-79 @AC-79.4
Scenario: SPECGEN004_654 Installed bundle survives dependency absence
  Given installed bundle launches without project node_modules
  When plan query and validation run against real data
  Then expected results return without silent dependency skip

@feature79 @FR-79 @AC-79.5
Scenario: SPECGEN004_655 Reports explain planning risk
  Given plan has migration debt conflicts broad impact critical work and stale evidence
  When reports query
  Then source task IDs and actionable redacted explanations return without exposing secret locator or environment values

@feature79 @FR-79 @AC-79.6
Scenario: SPECGEN004_656 Rollout never loses legacy task
  Given legacy task source in observe warn and enforce modes
  When reports generate
  Then count is preserved and enforce explicitly rejects unresolved record



@feature80 @FR-80 @AC-80.1 @AC-80.2 @AC-80.4 @AC-80.6 @AC-80.8
Scenario: SPECGEN004_657 synthesizes a DDD vertical acceptance slice before scheduling
  Given repository reality identifies the "task-synthesis" domain boundary, "TaskSynthesis" aggregate, "one lane per acceptance criterion" invariant, and "task/v1" contract
  And FR-80 has one applicable acceptance criterion and tagged BDD evidence
  When deterministic pre-scheduling synthesis runs
  Then it stores one `domainMode: ddd` canonical task/v1 vertical slice with its requirement, acceptance criterion, scenario, evidence, estimate, doneWhen, dependencies, and declared surfaces
  And no FR-72..FR-79 scheduling operation creates another planning graph

@feature80 @FR-80 @AC-80.1 @AC-80.3 @AC-80.8
Scenario: SPECGEN004_658 synthesizes an infrastructure slice without invented domain entities
  Given repository reality identifies a CLI module, filesystem adapter, and stable JSON contract but no domain boundary
  When deterministic pre-scheduling synthesis runs
  Then it stores `domainMode: none` with the module, adapter, and contract boundaries
  And the generated task has measurable doneWhen, an estimate, requirement and acceptance references, typed dependencies, and read, write, and exclusive surfaces
  And it does not create an entity, aggregate, or invariant

@feature80 @FR-80 @AC-80.5
Scenario: SPECGEN004_659 blocks finalization for an unknown implementation surface
  Given an applicable acceptance lane has no repository-supported implementation surface
  When deterministic pre-scheduling synthesis runs
  Then it creates a named BLOCKED investigation record that owns the acceptance lane
  And task finalization is rejected until that investigation is resolved

@feature80 @FR-80 @AC-80.1 @AC-80.4 @AC-80.9 @AC-80.10
Scenario: SPECGEN004_660 conserves every acceptance lane without loss or duplication
  Given ordered FR, acceptance-criterion, DESIGN, BDD, and repository-reality inputs contain three applicable acceptance lanes
  When deterministic pre-scheduling synthesis runs twice
  Then each result contains exactly three uniquely owned lanes and stable-key byte-equivalent canonical task/v1 records
  And a missing or duplicate source claim produces a named deterministic finding instead of silent loss or duplication
  And the stored SpecGraph is the direct input to FR-72..FR-79 planning

@feature80 @FR-80 @AC-80.6 @AC-80.7
Scenario: SPECGEN004_661 preserves BDD-only RED GREEN REFACTOR causal ordering
  Given an acceptance lane has a vertical BDD slice with RED, GREEN, and REFACTOR work
  When deterministic pre-scheduling synthesis validates the slice
  Then the slice owns its requirement, acceptance criterion, scenario, and verification evidence
  And it persists typed causal edges in RED then GREEN then REFACTOR order
  And a reordered, missing, or cross-slice causal edge is rejected



@feature80 @FR-80 @AC-80.10
Scenario: SPECGEN004_662 synthesizes canonical agent work from approved design ownership without micro-task explosion
  Given an approved design revision and digest plus a repository-verified component/interface responsibility map
  When deterministic task synthesis creates an AC/BDD vertical outcome
  Then the stored SpecGraph contains one canonical task with exact source locations and interfaces
  And its ordered 2–5-minute BDD-only RED, GREEN, and REFACTOR steps are embedded in its brief rather than separately schedulable graph nodes
  And conditional `domainMode: ddd` retains only verified boundaries while `domainMode: none` invents no domain entities

@feature80 @FR-80 @AC-80.10 @AC-80.11
Scenario: SPECGEN004_663 rejects an incomplete synthesis before planning
  Given a synthesized task set with a placeholder, an unconserved lane, missing ownership, no exact interface location, infeasible work, an untyped causal edge, and incomplete surfaces
  When the deterministic pre-planner synthesis review runs
  Then planning is rejected with stable named findings for every violation
  And a cyclic or reordered BDD-only RED to GREEN to REFACTOR edge is rejected before batching

@feature80 @FR-80 @AC-80.10 @AC-80.11
Scenario: SPECGEN004_664 projects an evidence-safe agent brief and machine-proven parallel batch
  Given canonical tasks with exact source context, interfaces, typed dependencies, predecessor summaries, scenarios, evidence commands, blockers, and declared surfaces
  When `TaskPlanResult` is projected for an AI agent
  Then each task brief is self-contained from the stored SpecGraph without a second plan authority or executor
  And a safe batch includes pairwise proof of no causal path in either direction and no conflict pair rather than an assertion in prose
  And only evidence-backed `DONE` completes a task while `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`, `NEEDS_CONTEXT`, and `BLOCKED` retain diagnostics and create follow-up proposals


@feature81 @FR-81 @AC-81.2 @AC-81.6
Scenario: SPECGEN004_665 Cursor mcp twin file ships the door bundle
  Given the repository root contains ".cursor/mcp.json"
  When the Cursor MCP config is loaded
  Then it names the "dev-pomogator-specs" server
  And the launch path includes "tools/spec-mcp-server/server.bundle.mjs"

@feature81 @FR-81 @AC-81.5 @AC-81.6
Scenario: SPECGEN004_666 root and Cursor door entries stay equivalent
  Given root ".mcp.json" and ".cursor/mcp.json" both declare "dev-pomogator-specs"
  When ensure-cursor-mcp runs with "--check"
  Then it exits 0 reporting the door entries match

@feature81 @FR-81 @AC-81.2
Scenario: SPECGEN004_667 resolveRepoRoot tolerates Cursor-like placeholder env
  Given DEV_POMOGATOR_REPO_ROOT is the literal "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}"
  And process.cwd() is a directory that contains ".specs"
  When resolveRepoRoot runs
  Then it returns the cwd that contains ".specs"

# Owner attestation 2026-08-04: verified in a live Cursor session by the owner; machine manifest not captured.
@live-evidence @live-attested @cursor-live @feature81 @FR-81 @AC-81.1 @AC-81.4
Scenario: SPECGEN004_668 Cursor session lists the MCP door
  Given Cursor Third-party skills are enabled and ".cursor/mcp.json" is loaded
  When the agent inspects the MCP tool catalog
  Then "dev-pomogator-specs" tools are listed

# Owner attestation 2026-08-04: raw-write deny + MCP apply verified in a live Cursor session by the owner; machine manifest not captured.
@live-evidence @live-attested @cursor-live @feature81 @FR-81 @AC-81.3 @AC-81.4
Scenario: SPECGEN004_669 Cursor enforce denies raw specs write and MCP apply succeeds
  Given SPEC_ACCESS enforce is on and project ".claude/settings.json" hooks are loaded in Cursor
  When the agent attempts a raw Write under ".specs/"
  Then the PreToolUse guard denies the write
  And a valid MCP apply_spec_change succeeds



@feature82 @FR-82 @AC-82.1
Scenario: SPECGEN004_670 lists every unfinished task with evidence-backed fields
  Given the live SpecGraph contains task nodes and the harness loads the captured corpus artifact for wf_0315d03b-28
  When the real list_tasks MCP handler is called for one spec without a status filter
  Then it returns every non-terminal task with id title status phase rationale links source location and evidence-backed blockers only
  And the response includes total returned truncated and next cursor metadata

@feature82 @FR-82 @AC-82.2
Scenario: SPECGEN004_671 paginates task inventory without silent caps or cardinality loss
  Given the real captured task corpus has more matching tasks than the requested page limit
  When the real list_tasks MCP handler is called repeatedly with its returned cursor
  Then the concatenated pages contain exactly total unique canonical task ids in stable order
  And every page reports returned cardinality consistently and no task is silently omitted
  And the reference corpus completes at most two pages when the limit is 200

@feature82 @FR-82 @AC-82.3
Scenario: SPECGEN004_672 distinguishes an unknown phase from an empty phase
  Given the real graph exposes canonical phases and the captured corpus has a known phase with no matching tasks
  When the real list_phase_tasks MCP handler is called with the spec and each phase query
  Then the known empty phase returns EMPTY_PHASE
  And the unknown phase returns PHASE_NOT_FOUND with nearest canonical phase candidates
  And a populated phase uses bounded deterministic pagination

@feature82 @FR-82 @AC-82.4
Scenario: SPECGEN004_673 searches one spec with complete cursor pagination
  Given the real graph contains matching and non-matching nodes across more than one page
  When the real search MCP handler is called with a spec scope and fixed query filters
  Then cursor pages concatenate to the complete matching set in stable order
  And total returned truncated and next cursor values conserve the matching cardinality

@feature82 @FR-82 @AC-82.5
Scenario: SPECGEN004_674 returns compact summary without unchanged census recomputation
  Given the real graph revision is unchanged between two summary requests
  When the real get_spec_status MCP handler is called with view summary twice
  Then each response contains status counts and gap summary but no full task inventory payload
  And the second call does not recompute an unchanged read-side global census

@feature82 @FR-82 @AC-82.6
Scenario: SPECGEN004_675 bounds document reads and suggests canonical missing-section anchors
  Given the real spec corpus contains a document larger than the safe page bound
  When the real read_spec_doc MCP handler is called without pagination and then with a missing section
  Then the first response is bounded and a whole-document read requires explicit opt-in
  And the missing section response identifies nearest canonical headings or anchors

@feature82 @FR-82 @AC-82.7
Scenario: SPECGEN004_676 keeps list phase documentation and tests truthful
  Given the live graph contains task nodes and the existing phase-query description and test are loaded
  When the list_phase_tasks contract regression runs through the real MCP handler
  Then neither the tool description nor the assertion claims that task nodes are not produced
  And a genuinely empty phase is not reported as evidence that the task inventory is absent

@feature82 @FR-82 @AC-82.8 @AC-82.9
Scenario: SPECGEN004_677 meets bounded incident verification without an N by M crawl
  Given the real captured wf_0315d03b-28 incident and corpus artifact are loaded rather than a hand-invented producer shape
  When one bounded task-inventory request and bounded verification are run through real MCP handlers
  Then the run stays within the declared maximum of three MCP calls, 512 KiB aggregate response bytes, and the declared page latency budget
  And the six retries, 695 calls, approximately 5.46 MB, and approximately 297 to 312k input tokens remain recorded as incident evidence rather than an eternal performance claim

@feature77 @FR-77 @AC-77.6
Scenario: SPECGEN004_678 Restored evidence is revalidated before completion
  Given persisted task evidence claims completion without canonical ownership bindings
  When task evidence restores and completion evaluates
  Then forged completion flags are ignored and the evidence remains non-completing history

@feature78 @FR-78 @AC-78.6
Scenario: SPECGEN004_679 Discovery approval state cannot be tampered
  Given a high impact discovery proposal requires approval
  When its caller changes approval state without changing the digest
  Then proposal integrity fails and no graph mutation commits

@feature79 @FR-79 @AC-79.7
Scenario: SPECGEN004_680 Stale evidence blocks plan completion
  Given a selected ready task has stale evidence
  When execution plan readiness evaluates
  Then the task is not ready and the plan is incomplete with a stale-evidence finding

@feature79 @FR-79 @AC-79.7
Scenario: SPECGEN004_681 Unrelated plan patch preserves explicit conflicts
  Given a plan has an explicit externally audited conflict
  When an unrelated valid patch commits
  Then the explicit conflict remains in the next plan state


@feature81 @FR-81 @AC-81.7
Scenario: SPECGEN004_682 Live evidence binds expected records to current producer artifacts
  Given a producer-derived live evidence manifest with current checkout and workspace bindings
  When the real live evidence validator checks missing and modified producer bindings
  Then missing expected records and changed trace or workspace evidence are rejected by named findings

@feature79 @FR-79 @AC-79.8
Scenario: SPECGEN004_683 Invalid canonical tasks keep plans incomplete
  Given a malformed canonical task reaches plan state construction
  When the canonical task plan is queried and restored
  Then the plan remains incomplete with a retained invalid-task finding

@feature79 @FR-79 @AC-79.8
Scenario: SPECGEN004_684 Storage compare-and-swap rejects the second writer
  Given two task plan writers read the same persisted revision
  When both writers apply different valid patches
  Then only the first storage compare-and-swap commits and the second reports stale revision

@feature80 @FR-80 @AC-80.12
Scenario: SPECGEN004_685 Synthesis rejects unresolved sources dependencies and blank causal work
  Given strict synthesis receives unresolved registries dependency targets and blank causal step text
  When deterministic pre-scheduling synthesis reviews the lanes
  Then named blocking findings reject every invalid reference and blank causal step

@feature63 @FR-63 @AC-63.4
Scenario: SPECGEN004_686 proven retired scenario keeps historical evidence but releases active execution debt
  Given a readiness fixture with a historical scenario superseded by an existing spec and a stale overlay pass
  When the readiness inventory classifies its scenario scopes
  Then the scenario is classified historical-retired with its overlay record preserved
  And the EXECUTION lane carries no debt for it while LIVE_EVIDENCE reports NONE without live scenarios

@feature63 @FR-63 @AC-63.4
Scenario: SPECGEN004_687 unproven historical and live scenarios remain honest readiness debt
  Given a readiness fixture with a bare historical scenario a dangling superseded scenario and a pending live scenario
  When the readiness inventory classifies its scenario scopes and evaluates readiness
  Then both unproven scenarios stay active EXECUTION debt under HISTORICAL_UNPROVEN
  And the live scenario blocks the LIVE_EVIDENCE lane until real producer proof arrives
  And an owner-attested live scenario satisfies the LIVE_EVIDENCE lane and DONE task truth without a machine result

@feature81 @FR-81 @AC-81.10
Scenario: SPECGEN004_688 Captured live evidence fixture validates against independent ground-truth digests
  Given a captured live evidence fixture with independent ground-truth digests
  When the real validator verifies the captured fixture and tampered variants
  Then the captured fixture passes against independent digests and one-byte tamper fails closed

@feature81 @FR-81 @AC-81.8
Scenario: SPECGEN004_689 Symlinked workspace and trace files cannot escape the repository
  Given a live evidence manifest whose workspace and trace files escape through symlinks
  When the real live evidence validator checks canonical path containment
  Then escaping workspace and trace evidence are rejected fail-closed by named findings

@feature81 @FR-81 @AC-81.9
Scenario: SPECGEN004_690 Unexpected evidence records fail closed under an expectation set
  Given a producer-derived manifest containing an unexpected extra evidence record
  When the real validator checks the manifest with and without an expectation set
  Then unexpected records fail closed while empty expectations stay permissive

@feature79 @FR-79 @AC-79.8
Scenario: SPECGEN004_691 Invalid canonical tasks never schedule and never complete
  Given a malformed canonical task is selected for planning
  When the plan schedules and a completion patch is applied
  Then the invalid task is unscheduled, blocked, and cannot complete

@feature80 @FR-80 @AC-80.12
Scenario: SPECGEN004_692 Synthesis rejects mismatched and inapplicable acceptance lanes
  Given strict synthesis receives a mismatched requirement lane and an inapplicable acceptance lane
  When deterministic synthesis finalizes and projects the mismatched plan
  Then mismatched and inapplicable lanes are rejected without an accepted projection

@feature58 @FR-58 @AC-58.1 @AC-58.3
Scenario: SPECGEN004_693 migrated form-contract scenarios own feature58 while FR-19 keeps only two-tier coverage
  Given the spec-generator-v4 spec graph built from the real repository
  When FR-19 and FR-58 tested-by coverage is read
  Then FR-19 is tested only by the two-tier policy scenarios SPECGEN004_49 and SPECGEN004_50
  And no scenario tagged feature58 is also tagged feature19
  And FR-58 owns at least 15 migrated SPECGEN003 form-contract scenarios

@feature26 @FR-26 @AC-26.2
Scenario: SPECGEN004_694 spec opt-out skips every semantic pair and records the reason
  Given a spec frontmatter opt-out is enabled and two FR-to-scenario pairs are prepared
  When the authoritative verdict evaluates semantic coverage
  Then no semantic subprocess is spawned
  And no semantic cache entry is created
  And the spec-check log contains one opt-out event for each pair
@feature83 @FR-83 @AC-83.1
Scenario: SPECGEN004_701 full Codex spec plugin installs beside narrow context-menu
  Given an isolated Codex home and distinct context-menu and spec-generator-v4 sources and manifests
  When the real Codex plugin install and catalog verification run
  Then the catalog contains exactly two unique plugin ids
  And spec-generator-v4 exports the canonical required MCP skill hook and phase surfaces
  And the context-menu manifest digest and exported surface match the pre-install baseline
  And only codex-init writes whitelist order and support status

@feature83 @FR-83 @AC-83.2
Scenario: SPECGEN004_702 plugin-cache cwd never becomes the target spec repository
  Given the bundled MCP registry runs from a Codex plugin-cache cwd with a separate target repository
  When real read attachment proposal mutation transaction status and create handlers execute
  Then every handler reports the same canonical target realpath
  And sibling-prefix and symlink or junction escapes are rejected by realpath confinement
  And the next live trace retains every declared AC scenario task design and story edge for the touched fixture
  And that live trace equals a fresh cold graph build
  And the plugin cache remains byte-identical

@feature83 @FR-83 @AC-83.3
Scenario: SPECGEN004_703 every Codex hook family reaches the existing spec-door policy
  Given the captured Codex hook corpus contains exactly these event families
    | family      | representative payload       | expected policy |
    | patch       | apply_patch                  | raw deny        |
    | shell       | shell command                | raw deny        |
    | plan        | update_plan                  | guarded         |
    | MCP mutation| mcp__dev_pomogator_specs__* | allow and audit |
  When the generated Codex routes normalize and dispatch every corpus row under spec-access enforce
  Then exactly four policy results exist and each result keeps its family identity
  And raw spec writes are denied while the equivalent MCP mutation is allowed and audited

@feature83 @FR-83 @AC-83.4
Scenario: SPECGEN004_704 native and fallback Codex phase spawn preserve orchestration truth
  Given the Codex phase adapter matrix contains exactly these branches
    | branch                  |
    | native Codex subagent   |
    | packaged built-in role  |
  When each branch executes a create-spec phase through the canonical gate and retry loop
  Then exactly two branch results preserve isolation MCP-only access STOP budgets retries and final failure semantics
  And no branch invokes claude -p implicitly
  And an unavailable selected branch stops with a named unsupported-host failure

@feature83 @FR-83 @AC-83.5
Scenario: SPECGEN004_705 every Codex semantic judgment outcome stays provenance-honest
  Given the semantic host corpus contains exactly these cases
    | case                    | expected outcome             |
    | supported path          | provenance-bearing judgment  |
    | absent executable       | not ready                    |
    | unsupported Desktop path| not ready                    |
    | timeout                 | not ready                    |
    | malformed response      | not ready                    |
  When the shared semantic host adapter evaluates every case
  Then exactly five independently keyed results exist
  And the supported result binds provider host command digest and timestamp provenance
  And no unavailable or invalid result is green

@feature83 @FR-83 @AC-83.6
Scenario: SPECGEN004_706 every generated Codex adapter drift class fails closed
  Given the projection drift corpus contains exactly these mutations
    | mutation      |
    | missing output|
    | stale output  |
    | extra output  |
    | hand modified |
  When adapter check evaluates each mutation against canonical fingerprints
  Then exactly four independent failures contain an actionable diff and source fingerprint
  And two clean generations are byte-identical

@feature83 @FR-83 @AC-83.7
Scenario: SPECGEN004_707 dependency-absent package and doctor expose every Codex health state
  Given a freshly packed spec-generator-v4 plugin without repository node_modules
  And the doctor corpus contains exactly these unhealthy states
    | state                  |
    | missing install        |
    | stale package          |
    | registry mismatch      |
    | hook mismatch          |
    | adapter drift          |
    | target root mismatch   |
    | unsupported host spawn |
    | semantic judge absent  |
  When the real launcher loads catalog skills and hooks and doctor evaluates every state
  Then the healthy canonical surface initializes without repository dependencies
  And exactly eight independently keyed actionable diagnoses exist

@feature83 @FR-83 @AC-83.8 @live-evidence
Scenario: SPECGEN004_708 fresh Codex Desktop task proves the installed spec workflow
  Given the full plugin is installed in an isolated Codex home and Codex Desktop has reloaded it
  When a fresh Desktop task uses an external repository through MCP guards and one phase subagent
  Then captured live evidence proves installed discovery list read mutate status raw-write deny phase execution and honest semantic status
  And the record binds Codex and plugin versions target and cache realpaths event ids timestamps checkout and package digests and this scenario id

@feature83 @FR-83 @AC-83.9
Scenario: SPECGEN004_709 Codex Desktop repo dogfood keeps the canonical contract
  Given the Codex Desktop host uses repo dogfood with evidence key desktop-repo
  When project discovery MCP guards and one phase smoke drive the real spec workflow
  Then graph registry hook policy and workflow semantics match the canonical contract
  And the result makes no installed-cache claim

@feature83 @FR-83 @AC-83.9
Scenario: SPECGEN004_710 Codex Desktop installed plugin keeps the canonical contract
  Given the Codex Desktop host uses an isolated installed plugin with evidence key desktop-installed
  When package discovery MCP guards and one phase smoke drive the real spec workflow after reload
  Then graph registry hook policy and workflow semantics match the canonical contract
  And installed-cache identity and live Desktop provenance are retained

@feature83 @FR-83 @AC-83.9
Scenario: SPECGEN004_711 Codex CLI repo dogfood keeps the canonical contract
  Given the Codex CLI host uses repo dogfood with evidence key cli-repo
  When project discovery MCP guards and one phase smoke drive the real spec workflow
  Then graph registry hook policy and workflow semantics match the canonical contract
  And the result cannot substitute for Desktop installed evidence

@feature83 @FR-83 @AC-83.9
Scenario: SPECGEN004_712 Codex CLI installed plugin keeps the canonical contract
  Given the Codex CLI host uses an isolated dependency-absent plugin with evidence key cli-installed
  When package discovery MCP guards and one phase smoke drive the real spec workflow
  Then graph registry hook policy and workflow semantics match the canonical contract
  And the result cannot substitute for Desktop installed evidence

@feature83 @FR-83 @AC-83.9
Scenario: SPECGEN004_713 host and distribution evidence has exact four-row cardinality
  Given the matrix expects desktop-repo desktop-installed cli-repo and cli-installed evidence keys
  When matrix completeness is evaluated
  Then exactly four unique row results exist
  And no missing duplicated substituted or silently merged row can pass

@feature83 @FR-83 @AC-83.10
Scenario: SPECGEN004_714 Codex support adds no second control plane or spec engine
  Given the forbidden dependency inventory contains exactly these classes
    | class                                  |
    | duplicate SpecGraph                    |
    | duplicate MCP registry                 |
    | duplicate task or status store         |
    | duplicate canonical rules authority    |
    | Codex task or thread management API    |
    | scheduled automation                   |
    | connector or app protocol              |
    | context-menu behavior change           |
    | Cursor FR-81 ownership replacement     |
  When the FR-83 package and dependency graph are inspected
  Then exactly nine forbidden-class checks are absent
  And only the declared thin host and generated distribution adapters remain

Scenario: SPECGEN004_715 canonical remediation discovers once repairs only through MCP and ends with an honest verdict
  Given a committed damaged spec-dashboard fixture is copied to a temporary workspace
  And the mutable canonical ".specs/spec-dashboard/" is excluded from the workspace and remains byte-identical
  And one immutable graph and document snapshot contains structural audit conformance traceability readiness coverage evidence reality BDD-sync provider-delivery and semantic inputs
  And the snapshot includes task cards and list_tasks inventory, find_refs and get_trace distinctions, unavailable history, real browser journey proof, performance accessibility security and dependency-absent delivery evidence
  When the bounded remediation workflow normalizes the consolidated findings and evaluates at most three repair rounds
  Then every normalized finding has a stable fingerprint severity layer document node location owner evidence repairability repair class affected hashes dependencies attempts and state
  And the only repair classes are SAFE_MCP_PATCH SANCTIONED_FORM PROPOSAL_ONLY DECISION_REQUIRED and NONE
  And safe and sanctioned repairs use only propose_patch apply_proposed_patch or apply_spec_transaction with CAS and atomicity
  And proposal-only findings remain unapplied, decision-required findings contain alternatives rationale requirement affected nodes or documents and an explicit owner, and no semantic or product choice is guessed
  And direct spec writes and ".progress.json" writes are not performed
  And stale CAS refusal transaction rollback dependency blocks and repeated fingerprints with unchanged affected hashes remain explicit outcomes rather than convergence
  And one mandatory final smart spec-verdict pass distinguishes structural pass from READY and reports repaired blocking deferred decision-required unavailable-provider stale and NO_PROGRESS states with next actions
  And a second run against the repaired temporary fixture performs zero writes


  @FR-56 @AC-56.5 @feature56
  Scenario: SPECGEN004_756 pytest-bdd execution reaches the scenario evidence overlay
    Given a real pytest-bdd project with passing, failing, and unselected scenarios
    When pytest-bdd runs through the centralized runner overlay environment
    Then SpecGraph classifies only the unselected pytest-bdd scenario as not run



# Source contract; executable mirror: tests/features/plugins/specs-workflow/PLUGIN006_specs-generator.feature.
# Tagged @wip until the FR-85 implementation and real step definitions land.
@wip @FR-85 @AC-85.1 @feature85
Scenario: SPECGEN004_850 every active FR owns exactly one typed contract card
  Given a spec snapshot contains active and disposition FR nodes
  When the canonical requirement contract parser runs
  Then every active FR has one contract card and every superseded or out-of-scope FR has a disposition card that inherits observables negative_cases and verification and adds status rationale owner and exactly one successor-or-boundary field
  And removing any inherited observable negative_case or verification child from the disposition card fails validation

@wip @FR-85 @AC-85.2 @feature85
Scenario: SPECGEN004_851 common card fields and closed kinds are enforced
  Given a contract card corpus contains valid and invalid common fields
  When the shared contract validator runs
  Then missing common fields, unknown versions, prose-only cards, and unknown kinds produce located blocking findings
  And the verification block requires method, required_evidence, scenario.refs-or-pending, implementation_surface.refs-or-unknown, evidence_policy.source/freshness/independent, and a mutation removing each child independently fails

@wip @FR-85 @AC-85.3 @feature85
Scenario: SPECGEN004_852 interface kinds expose concrete boundary fields
  Given the corpus contains CLI API schema and filesystem cards
  When kind-specific validation runs
  Then CLI cards declare executable args input output exit_codes and errors, API cards declare method-or-tool request response authority and errors, schema cards declare typed required-optional enum and forbidden fields, and filesystem cards declare confined artifact path action owner resulting state atomicity and rollback
  And removing any named kind-specific field fails that kind while leaving other kinds valid

@wip @FR-85 @AC-85.4 @feature85
Scenario: SPECGEN004_853 event state and behavior kinds remain typed
  Given the corpus contains event state policy behavior and disposition cards
  When kind-specific validation runs
  Then event cards declare name producer payload consumers ordering and retry-duplicate semantics, state cards declare states transitions guards and terminal outcomes, behavior cards declare actor trigger preconditions observable and forbidden outcomes, and disposition cards inherit observable negative and verification fields while declaring status rationale owner and successor-or-boundary
  And removing any named event state behavior or disposition field fails the corresponding kind

@wip @FR-85 @AC-85.5 @feature85
Scenario: SPECGEN004_854 negative cases block happy-path-only cards
  Given a valid card is copied into a mutation corpus
  When the negative_cases entry is removed
  Then validation returns FR_CONTRACT_NEGATIVE_CASE_MISSING and the contract lane is not ready

@wip @FR-85 @AC-85.6 @feature85
Scenario: SPECGEN004_855 contract metadata survives graph and MCP round-trip
  Given a valid card is stored in the cold graph and warm store
  When the node is read and rendered through MCP
  Then all card fields and unknown forward-compatible keys are semantically equal after round-trip, and canonical rendering preserves stable field ordering

@wip @FR-85 @AC-85.7 @feature85
Scenario: SPECGEN004_856 contract findings identify their owner and repair
  Given a missing, malformed, unsupported-kind, incomplete, duplicate, and unresolved card corpus exists
  When conformance evaluates the corpus
  Then each finding has a stable code, qualified node, source line, severity, and actionable suggestion

@wip @FR-85 @AC-85.8 @feature85
Scenario: SPECGEN004_857 CONTRACT lane blocks structural-only green
  Given a spec has zero structural errors but one missing contract card
  When the authoritative smart verdict runs
  Then CONTRACT and OVERALL are NOT_READY and the result does not claim GREEN

@wip @FR-85 @AC-85.8 @feature85
Scenario: SPECGEN004_862 valid contract card keeps other readiness lanes honest
  Given a valid contract card has no implementation BDD or evidence
  When the authoritative smart verdict runs
  Then the CONTRACT lane is GREEN while implementation execution and evidence lanes remain NOT_READY

@wip @FR-85 @AC-85.9 @feature85
Scenario: SPECGEN004_858 MCP authoring is validated before write
  Given an agent proposes a valid and an invalid contract mutation through the spec door
  When the mutation transaction runs under CAS
  Then the invalid change is refused before disk access and the valid change is atomic and audited

@wip @FR-85 @AC-85.10 @feature85
Scenario: SPECGEN004_859 suggest-only migration does not invent values
  Given a legacy corpus has prose-only FRs and partially evidenced boundaries
  When the migration report runs with --suggest-only
  Then the report inventories every FR with suggested kind, missing fields, source locations, and NEEDS_CLARIFICATION markers while documents remain byte-identical and no values are invented

@wip @FR-85 @AC-85.11 @feature85
Scenario: SPECGEN004_860 strictness is engine-owned across new and legacy specs
  Given a new scaffold and a legacy spec are evaluated under their respective policy states
  When the strictness resolver runs
  Then new specs require cards, legacy debt is visible, and no FR or environment flag can downgrade strict mode

@wip @FR-85 @AC-85.12 @feature85
Scenario: SPECGEN004_861 contract traceability and mutation gates are complete
  Given the full FR-85 corpus has cards, AC links, scenarios, tasks, and evidence policies
  When the final contract verification runs
  Then removing a common field, negative case, kind-specific field, FR-AC-scenario edge, task-own-scenario edge, verification evidence/implementation-surface trace, or CONTRACT verdict lane fails the relevant contract/readiness lane, and restoring each mutation passes it independently

@feature44
Scenario: SPECGEN004_863 recursive reverse trace preserves nested spec slugs
  Given a nested spec corpus with unlinked research and upstream artifacts
  When the recursive reverse trace scanners run
  Then the reverse trace findings preserve the nested spec slug

@feature86 @FR-86 @AC-86.1 @AC-86.2 @AC-86.11
Scenario: SPECGEN004_864 Canonical readiness action groups retain their legacy compatibility projection
  Given an isolated readiness fixture has a real graph and unrun canonical scenario
  When the canonical verdict and MCP status are evaluated from that graph
  Then the canonical action groups completely and deterministically represent every blocking readiness lane

@feature86 @FR-86 @AC-86.3 @AC-86.4 @AC-86.5 @AC-86.6 @AC-86.7
Scenario: SPECGEN004_865 Evidence derives untagged and implementation-only state while preserving producer receipt provenance
  Given an isolated evidence fixture contains untagged and implemented requirements
  When the real inventory classifies absent, suite-only, and producer-generated evidence before a stale weak-evidence projection
  Then per-FR evidence states, ingestion diagnostics, and producer provenance remain honest

@feature86 @FR-86 @AC-86.8
Scenario: SPECGEN004_866 Root admission redacts preflight facts and refuses a cross-worktree write before side effects
  Given a valid spec document is rooted outside its declared worktree
  When the real MCP preflight and mutation boundary receive that mismatch
  Then preflight redacts identities and the mismatch refuses before any document lock or audit write

@feature86 @FR-86 @AC-86.9 @AC-86.10 @AC-86.12
Scenario: SPECGEN004_867 Guided contract authoring refuses invalid cards then atomically applies a valid card
  Given a guided contract fixture exposes the real proposal and atomic apply doors
  When an invalid card and then a valid CLI card are proposed and applied through the real MCP registry
  Then guided proposal payloads are exact, invalid or stale proposals write zero target spec document bytes and create no proposal or state mutation, while the required append-only spec-access audit entry remains permitted
