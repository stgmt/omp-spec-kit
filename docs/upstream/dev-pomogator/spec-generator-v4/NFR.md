# Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

## Performance

### NFR-Performance-1

**SpecGraph cold start**
System SHALL build full SpecGraph from cold start in **≤2 seconds** for project with up to 30 specs (~300 MD files + 50 `.feature` + 1 NDJSON). Larger projects SHOULD complete linearly (target: ≤10s for 200 specs before re-evaluating SQLite persistence per FR-10).

### NFR-Performance-2

**Incremental reindex latency**
System SHALL update SpecGraph on single-file change in **≤100ms p95** for projects up to 30 specs. Includes: chokidar event → re-parse changed file → graph updates → invalidate dependent backlinks.

### NFR-Performance-3

**MCP tool response time**
System SHALL respond to MCP tool calls within these p95 budgets:
- `get_trace(id)`: ≤50ms
- `find_by_tags(tags)`: ≤30ms
- `conformance_check(scope: single FR)`: ≤200ms (without semantic check)
- `conformance_check(scope: "all")`: ≤2s for 30 specs
- `search(query)`: ≤100ms text-only, ≤500ms with semantic embeddings

### NFR-Performance-4

**PostToolUse hook latency budget**
System hook fires within `throttle_ms` budget (default 3000ms). Within window: incremental reindex ≤100ms + conformance check ≤200ms + aggregation/dedupe ≤50ms. Total push-to-context latency ≤500ms after throttle window closes.

### NFR-Performance-5

**Cross-spec reconcile budget (Phase 7)**
`Skill("cross-spec-reconcile", mode: "light")` SHALL complete within 5 seconds for a 30-spec corpus (mechanical-only checks: glob + remark parse + Jaccard concept overlap + file existence + identifier extraction regex). `mode: "full"` has no time budget but SHALL cache pairwise semantic-judge results in `.dev-pomogator/.cross-spec-cache/<sha256(spec_a_content + spec_b_content)>.json` to avoid re-evaluating unchanged pairs across runs. Pre-filter SHALL skip Agent subagent invocation for pairs with <3 concept-noun overlap to bound N×N cost.

### NFR-Performance-6

**UserPromptSubmit summary render budget (FR-20)**
FR-20 threshold-only summary renderer SHALL complete in **≤50ms p95** between `UserPromptSubmit` hook invocation and the line being emitted to agent context. Reads from `~/.dev-pomogator/logs/form-guards.log` AND latest `.dev-pomogator/.spec-check-log/<YYYY-MM-DD>.jsonl` are capped at last 1000 entries per file to bound scan cost. Threshold-tracker state (`~/.dev-pomogator/state/last-summary-ack.json`) is read+written atomically via temp-file-rename pattern (NFR-Reliability-2).

### NFR-Performance-7

**PostToolUse throttle is fixed-window (FR-28)**
FR-6 PostToolUse 3-second throttle SHALL be implemented as a **fixed window** (not sliding, not debounce). First qualifying event at `t0` opens a window `[t0, t0 + throttle_ms]`; subsequent events within the window batch into it; at window close the aggregated findings push once and the throttle resets. New event at `t0 + throttle_ms + ε` opens a fresh window. Latency upper-bound for the author: `throttle_ms` from the first edit in a burst (default 3000ms). Sliding-window / debounce semantics are explicitly out of scope — they could indefinitely defer push during continuous edits.

### NFR-Performance-8

**Anchor-integrity check latency budget (FR-34)**
The anchor-integrity check on a SINGLE touched spec (PostToolUse path) SHALL complete in **≤150ms p95** for specs up to ~40 headings (slug computation is pure-string; no LSP round-trip). A full-corpus check (CI / `--all`) SHALL be O(headings+links) and complete in **≤3s** for the 48-spec corpus (~1500 headings, ~4440 links). The deterministic fixer SHALL add no LSP/network call; the `claude -p` branch runs in the background and is NOT counted against the edit-path budget.

## Security

### NFR-Security-1

**No env-var bypass for HARD hooks**
System HARD hooks (`spec-conformance-guard`, PreToolUse syntax checks) MUST NOT have environment variable bypass. No `SPEC_CONFORMANCE_DISABLE=1` or similar. Pattern proven by v3 form-guards. Agents physically cannot disable enforcement. Soft features (PostToolUse push, semantic check) MAY have config-flag opt-out via `.spec-config.json` (NOT env-var) to prevent CI bypass.

### NFR-Security-2

**Meta-guard protects manifest**
System SHALL include meta-guard hook that DENIES removal of conformance guard from `extension.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json`. Pattern from v3 `extension-json-meta-guard`. Tampering attempts logged to `.dev-pomogator/logs/meta-guard.log`.

### NFR-Security-3

**No hardcoded user identifiers**
System MUST NOT embed maintainer-specific identifiers (GitHub owner/repo, user paths) into shipped artifacts. All such values derived at runtime (`git remote get-url`, `gh api user`, `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, `path.basename(cwd)`). See memory `feedback_no-hardcoded-repo-or-user-identifiers`.

### NFR-Security-4

**Env-first config resolution**
System SHALL resolve config-derivable values via strict order: env file `~/.dev-pomogator/{component}.env` → runtime investigation (verified commands, not fantasy) → AskUserQuestion with derived default → persist outcome. See memory `feedback_env-first-then-investigate-then-ask`.

### NFR-Security-5

**SQLite file permissions (Phase 4)**
When SQLite persistence enabled — `.dev-pomogator/.spec-index.sqlite` file mode SHALL be `0600` (owner read/write only). Lock file `.dev-pomogator/.mcp-lock.json` same. Prevents accidental sharing in multi-user systems.

### NFR-Security-6

**Cross-spec reconcile respects boundaries (Phase 7)**
Reconcile skill MUST NOT read secret files even when globbed by its `.specs/*/` + impl-tree scan. It SHALL honor `boundaries.never[]` array from `.specs/.onboarding.json` if present (e.g. `.env`, `*.pem`, `credentials.json`, `~/.config/**`); else falls back to a hardcoded deny-list (`.env`, `.env.*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*credentials*`, `**/secrets/**`). Override audit log `.claude/logs/cross-spec-overrides.jsonl` SHALL never contain secret values — only finding codes + reason text + session_id.

### NFR-Security-7

**LLM-as-judge content boundary (FR-26)**
FR-8 semantic-drift `claude -p` subprocess MUST NOT receive content matching the deny-list defined in FR-26 (file-name globs + body-content regex covering API keys, bearer tokens, private keys, password assignments). Matched inputs SKIP the subprocess invocation entirely and emit a `SEMANTIC_CHECK_SKIPPED_DENY_LIST` finding — never substituting a false «no drift detected» result. Per-spec opt-out (`spec_llm_judge_deny: true` frontmatter) FORCES skip regardless of content; no «allow-list override» exists. Extends NFR-Security-6 boundary policy from reconcile to FR-8's subprocess channel.

### NFR-Security-8

**Marksman LSP supply-chain verification (FR-27)**
FR-7 Marksman binary `postInstall` download MUST verify sha256 against the pinned hash in `package.json::marksmanHashes` (or sibling `marksman-hashes.json`) for the current platform/arch/version triple. Mismatch → install ABORTS with explicit error message naming both hashes; downloaded file deleted. Hash list updates require explicit `dev-pomogator update-marksman-hashes` CLI invocation with maintainer-provided upstream sha256 — no auto-update from GitHub releases API.

## Reliability

### NFR-Reliability-1

**Graceful degradation on missing NDJSON**
System SHALL function with reduced capability when `reqnroll_report.ndjson` / equivalent is absent. `get_trace` returns nodes WITHOUT test result data (scenarios listed without `lastResult` field). Warning surfaced via `STALE_NDJSON` or `NO_TEST_RUN_DATA` finding. No crash, no blocked spec workflow.

### NFR-Reliability-2

**Atomic config writes**
System SHALL write all config / state files atomically (temp file + atomic move). Applies to `.spec-config.json`, `.mcp-lock.json`, `.spec-index.sqlite` (via WAL). Prevents corruption on crash mid-write. Pattern from `atomic-config-save` rule.

### NFR-Reliability-3

**Lock file stale detection**
`.mcp-lock.json` MUST check existing pid validity via `process.kill(pid, 0)` on startup. If pid not alive (ESRCH) — lock deleted, new lock created atomically (`flag: 'wx'`).

### NFR-Reliability-4

**chokidar polling fallback**
System SHALL auto-detect FS events reliability via touch test at startup (create temp file, await event ≤500ms). If event missed → enable polling mode (1s interval) + log decision. Covers Docker Desktop bind-mounts, WSL2 `/mnt/c/...`, network FS.

### NFR-Reliability-5

**SQLite corruption recovery (Phase 4)**
System SHALL run `PRAGMA integrity_check` on SQLite at startup. If failure → auto-fallback to in-memory rebuild + corrupted file moved to `.dev-pomogator/.spec-index.sqlite.corrupt-{timestamp}` for postmortem + warning logged.

### NFR-Reliability-6

**Marksman crash isolation (native LSP, no fake fallback)**
Marksman runs as a NATIVE Claude Code LSP plugin (`.lsp.json`), so Claude Code's LSP host owns the subprocess lifecycle — including restart (`maxRestarts` in `.lsp.json`). If Marksman is genuinely unavailable (crash, offline + unsupported platform), markdown navigation is simply absent with an actionable message — the system SHALL NOT fake a degraded JS MD-LSP (FR-7a). Spec-DOMAIN queries (`get_trace` / `get_coverage` / `find_refs`) are graph-backed and unaffected by Marksman's state.

### NFR-Reliability-7

**Cross-spec reconcile graceful degradation (Phase 7)**
Reconcile YAML write SHALL be atomic (temp file `consistency-report.yaml.tmp` + rename, per `.claude/rules/atomic-config-save.md`). Agent subagent invocations SHALL have a 120-second per-pair timeout; on timeout fallback to mechanical-only mode + log warning. If subagent completes on some pairs but fails on others, YAML `partial: true` flag set + warning emitted; system does NOT fail-loud. If SpecGraph + MCP server (Phase 1) unavailable, reconcile operates in degraded mode reading `.specs/*/*.md` directly via `fs` + `remark` + `glob`. Existing `acknowledged_by` / `resolution_status` fields are preserved on merge writes (never overwritten by new run).

### NFR-Reliability-8

**Two-tier hook failure-mode invariants (FR-19)**
PreToolUse hooks SHALL follow the two-tier failure policy defined in FR-19. SOFT tier (5 v3 form-guards + meta-guard): on ANY exception (parse, IO, runtime, timeout) MUST log to `~/.dev-pomogator/logs/form-guards.log` AND exit 0 (allow operation). HARD tier (`spec-conformance-guard`, FR-5): startup/config crash → exit 1 + stderr (hard fail surfaces broken install); per-file content-parse exception → log to spec-check-log JSONL + exit 0 (graceful per-file degradation). Rationale documented in DESIGN.md «Hook failure-mode tiers» paragraph. Single-tier «all fail-open» creates a known bypass vector (malicious .md crashes hard guard → unprotected Writes everywhere) and is explicitly rejected.

### NFR-Reliability-9

**Anchor auto-fix is non-blocking, idempotent, and never guesses (FR-34c)**
The auto-fix `claude -p`/background branch MUST NOT block the triggering Write/Edit — it is dispatched detached and reports asynchronously. The deterministic branch MUST be idempotent (`fix(fix(x))==fix(x)`) and MUST only rewrite an anchor when the target heading is unambiguously identified by id; ambiguous links are left flagged, never guess-rewritten (a wrong auto-rewrite is worse than a flagged broken link). The Stop-gate escape hatch `[skip-anchor-fix:]` MUST be append-logged to `.claude/logs/` for audit (mirrors the scope-gate escape-hatch discipline). PostToolUse anchor-check exceptions follow the SOFT-tier policy (log + exit 0 — never block the edit on a checker bug).

### NFR-Reliability-10

**Test-quality gate must not false-block a strong test (FR-35)**
The test-quality gate MUST have zero false positives on a `STRONG` verdict — a wrongful block erodes trust and trains agents to game the `[skip-test-quality:]` escape (the same failure mode the gate exists to prevent). The test-body audit MUST run within the existing `get_coverage` latency budget (no separate >2s per-task stall); when the auditor is unavailable the gate MUST degrade to the current PASS/FAIL behaviour + a visible `TASK_TEST_QUALITY=unknown` note (fail-open, never silently pass a possibly-fake test as DONE).

## Usability

### NFR-Usability-1

**Single-call agent context**
Primary tool `get_trace(node_id)` MUST provide enough context for agent to reason about the node WITHOUT follow-up file Read operations. Measured: agent test fixture invokes `get_trace("FR-001")` then produces coherent next action — without any Read tool call for spec files.

### NFR-Usability-2

**Actionable error messages**
Every `conformance_check` finding MUST include `suggestions[]` array with concrete actions (`rename_ref`, `remove_ref`, `create_fr`, etc.) with `confidence` score + `reason`. Agent never has to investigate "what's wrong" — finding tells it.

### NFR-Usability-3

**No hidden state**
All v4 state derivable from filesystem (`.specs/`, `.feature`, NDJSON) + `.spec-config.json`. No hidden caches surviving across CLI invocations (in-memory only — process restart = clean state). Phase 4 SQLite — explicit and inspectable via standard `sqlite3` CLI.

### NFR-Usability-4

**Migration is interactive, never silent**
`dev-pomogator migrate-v3-to-v4` MUST require explicit user consent per file (default `skip` if no input within 30s). Never auto-rewrite without confirm. `--suggest-only` mode for preview-without-apply.

### NFR-Usability-5

**Backward compat as first-class concern**
System MUST work with legacy v3 specs without ANY migration (read-only compat mode). Triple-anchor registration in custom MD parser. Agent gets less context for legacy specs (no IDE wiki-links until migration) but workflow not broken. User chooses when/whether to migrate.

### NFR-Usability-6

**Cross-platform install**
System SHALL install successfully on: Windows 10/11, macOS 12+, Ubuntu 20.04+, Alpine Linux 3.18+. Marksman binary bundled per-platform. Native deps minimized (pure JS preferred). Install verified via CI matrix.

### NFR-Usability-7

**Cross-spec reconcile CRITICAL prompt rendering (Phase 7)**
CRITICAL blocking AskUserQuestion SHALL use `header: "⚠️ CRIT"` (≤12 chars to satisfy AskUserQuestion schema constraint). Actual color rendering of the chip/tag is up to the Claude Code client (terminal vs web vs IDE) — the system guarantees only that the ⚠️ symbol + CAPS string telegraphs severity, NOT a specific red color. Resolve skill 5-field explanation block SHALL use fenced code blocks for diff preview so terminal and web clients render them legibly. Foreign-spec edit banner «⚠️ This edits foreign spec: …» SHALL be a separate line above the per-finding AskUserQuestion to maximize visibility.

## Legacy v3 budgets (preserved from spec-generator-v3, consolidated 2026-05-28)

These NFRs were the shipped contracts of spec-generator-v3 (PR #14) and remain in force for v4's soft-tier hook system (FR-19). They are reproduced here so the v3 spec folder can be deleted without losing the performance + reliability guarantees the production code depends on.

### NFR-Legacy-1

**Soft-tier hook chain latency**
Each soft-tier form-guard SHALL short-circuit in ≤30ms for non-target files (filename filter in the first 3 lines of the hook). Full validation SHALL complete in ≤150ms p95 worst case on a 500-line spec. The serial chain of all 6 v3 form-guards (kept verbatim by v4 FR-19) SHALL add ≤180ms per Write/Edit invocation.

### NFR-Legacy-2

**Audit log append latency**
`audit-logger.logEvent` SHALL complete in ≤5ms p95 (synchronous `appendFileSync` to `~/.dev-pomogator/logs/form-guards.log`). v4 FR-23 keeps this file path and write path verbatim.

### NFR-Legacy-3

**Audit log retention and rotation**
The form-guards log SHALL retain 30 days of events, with the file capped at 10MB. Rotation runs via `validate-specs.ts` once per session. v4 FR-23 keeps these parameters; v4's separate `.dev-pomogator/.spec-check-log/<DATE>.jsonl` (FR-15) has its own 10MB rotation independent of this one.

### NFR-Legacy-4

**Hook fail-open safety invariant**
Every soft-tier hook SHALL be wrapped in `main().catch(() => exit(0))` so an internal exception never blocks a legitimate Write. v4 FR-19 + NFR-Reliability-8 codify this as the soft-tier rule.

### NFR-Legacy-5

**UserPromptSubmit summary latency (v3 behavior)**
`renderFormGuardsSummary` SHALL complete in ≤50ms (read + parse last 24h events from `~/.dev-pomogator/logs/form-guards.log`). v4 supersedes the v3 «render at every prompt» behavior with FR-20 threshold-only + on-demand `/spec-status` (B3 + B4); the underlying renderer code path SHALL be preserved unchanged as long as v3 form-guards remain installed.

### NFR-Legacy-6

**Backward-compat for `.progress.json::version` reads**
`readProgressState` SHALL continue to ignore unknown fields so that v4's `version: 4` bump does not break v3-era readers still loaded in target projects mid-migration.

### NFR-Reliability-11

**Spec-qualified-id migration is phased and never ships a red suite (FR-36)**
The node-identity refactor (FR-36) SHALL be applied in phases that each leave the full clean-HEAD Docker suite green, verified clean-vs-clean per the `suite-failure-triage` discipline — the suite was previously "green" on a broken graph precisely because tests asserted bare ids that happened to resolve, so test churn (every bare-id assertion → qualified form) SHALL be updated in lockstep within the phase that changes the identity. Bare-id tool lookups SHALL degrade to a candidate list (soft back-compat), never a hard break, so agent callers that know only `FR-2` keep working. The `server.bundle.mjs` SHALL be rebuilt after any `tools.ts` change so plugin users get the fix.

### NFR-Performance-9

**De-collision SHALL NOT regress graph build time (FR-36)**
After FR-36 the graph holds ≈470 FR nodes instead of 47 (collision-dropped); the full-corpus build (`buildGraphFromCwd` over all `.specs/`) SHALL stay within the existing MCP cold-start budget (NFR-Performance bounds) — the extra nodes are ones already parsed-then-dropped, so the work is bounded by parse cost already paid, not new I/O.

## NFR-Performance-10 (FR-39)

`spec-access-guard` SHALL отвечать ALLOW на НЕ-матчащий вызов за ≤10ms собственной логики (path-фильтр до любого I/O; паттерн form-guards-dispatch); матчащий вызов (лог/deny) — ≤50ms. Лог `spec-access.jsonl` SHALL НЕ читаться в prompt-time пути FR-20 (отдельный файл, отдельный бюджет) — 50ms-бюджет AC-20.2 не затрагивается.

## NFR-Reliability-11 (FR-39/FR-40)

`spec-access.jsonl` — append-only O_APPEND, ротация 10MB/30 дней по образцу audit-logger; guard и mutation-тулзы SOFT-tier: внутренняя ошибка → fail-open (allow + лог), никогда не вешать сессию. Отказ mutation-валидации — это НЕ ошибка тулзы (нормальный findings-ответ).

## NFR-Reliability-12 (FR-41)

Фазовый headless-агент SHALL иметь таймаут (default 15 мин, конфигурируемо) и бюджет ретраев гейта (default 2); исчерпание → оркестратор останавливается с явным FAIL-отчётом фазы (никогда не вечное ожидание и не тихий пропуск фазы).


### NFR-Performance-11

**Completion-evidence gate budget:** AC/NFR satisfaction plus artifact-manifest evaluation SHALL keep the existing agent-facing MCP/readiness response budget on a corpus of at least 811 AC nodes and 58 NFR nodes. Graph-only evaluation SHALL be linear in nodes plus edges; artifact hashing/probing SHALL be cached by stable path+size+mtime+digest metadata and SHALL NOT reread unchanged media on every status query.

### NFR-Security-9

**Artifact path confinement and bounded parsing:** Evidence paths SHALL resolve under the owning spec's declared attachment root; absolute paths, `..` traversal and symlink/junction escape SHALL be rejected. A manifest SHALL provide SHA-256 and byte size. Configurable byte/duration limits SHALL be enforced before semantic review; hashing and media probing SHALL stream rather than buffer the full artifact.

### NFR-Reliability-13

**Required evidence fails closed:** When a required artifact, integrity probe or independent judge is unavailable, malformed or times out, operational proof SHALL remain incomplete with an actionable retry reason; the system SHALL NOT infer CONFIRMED or PRESENT. This intentionally differs from NFR-Reliability-10's fail-open policy for advisory test-body auditing: operational proof is a delivery obligation whose absence is itself material evidence, so fail-open would recreate false completion. Optional evidence SHALL remain non-blocking.


## NFR-Performance-12 (FR-72..FR-79)

**Execution-plan workload and harness budget:** A benchmark corpus SHALL contain exactly 300 canonical `task/v1` tasks, 450 typed dependency edges distributed across at least 30 independent branches and at least 60 join/fan-in edges, and 1,500 surface claims distributed across every supported claim kind and all read/write/exclusive access modes. Cold means no in-memory graph, normalized-claim index, planner cache, or SQLite page cache; warm means all four are populated from the identical corpus. Harness SHALL run at least 30 independently timed warm queries after one warm-up pass, calculate p95 without excluding slow samples, and require ≤200ms. Validation/planning SHALL be linear or near-linear in nodes, edges, and claims except configured bounded conflict partitioning; discovery validation SHALL enforce child-count, scope, and write budgets before expansion.

## NFR-Reliability-14 (FR-72..FR-79)

**Determinism and completion truth:** Equal `task/v1` canonical JSON, selected-ID set, revision set, and configuration SHALL yield byte-equivalent stable-key JSON for model, DAG, conflict graph, waves, batches, critical path, slack, findings, and report order across incremental, defined cold, and defined warm paths. Every collection SHALL sort first by normalized qualified ID and then canonical secondary key; estimates SHALL use documented half-up minute rounding before path calculation. Cycles, stale completion, invalid estimates, and missing selected IDs SHALL fail closed with named findings and no inferred completion or schedule. Optional scheduling hints, absent-estimate defaults, and reconciliation advisories SHALL fail open only with explicit assumptions and SHALL never make blocked work READY or DONE.

## NFR-Security-10 (FR-74, FR-79)

**Surface confinement, normalization, and redaction:** Before validation, every file/glob locator SHALL undergo Unicode NFC normalization and platform-aware case normalization. The validator SHALL reject `..` traversal, absolute drive/root paths, UNC paths, normalization collisions, and any normalized or realpath-resolved target that escapes approved repository root. It SHALL resolve each existing component through realpath and reject symlink/junction escape. Glob expansion SHALL enforce configured maximum depth and match count before enumeration is returned. Locators/rationales are inert data: planner SHALL not execute command, script, URL, shell fragment, or embedded credential from them. MCP responses, diagnostics, reports, audits, evidence environments, and plan output SHALL redact secret-like values, preserving only non-secret path identity required for actionability.

## NFR-Reliability-15 (FR-72, FR-77, FR-78)

**Migration and discovery preservation:** Migration, parser, renderer, persistence, and rollout SHALL never silently drop tasks, dependencies, evidence, or discovery output. Legacy/rejected items, no-child results, and historical stale evidence remain inspectable with source identity and reason.



## NFR-Performance-13 (FR-82)

**Bounded MCP read budget:** A `list_tasks` page SHALL default to at most 50 items and SHALL enforce a maximum of 200 items. A page response SHALL be at most 256 KiB and SHALL complete within 2 seconds warm or 5 seconds cold in the integration harness. On the 280-task reference corpus, a complete unfinished inventory SHALL require no more than two pages plus one bounded verification call, no more than 512 KiB aggregate response bytes, and no per-task follow-up calls. These are test budgets for the declared corpus, not a universal claim about every repository or network.

## NFR-Reliability-16 (FR-82)

**Pagination and read truth:** Every bounded collection response SHALL expose `total`, `returned`, `truncated`, and `next_cursor` as applicable; cursor ordering SHALL be stable for an unchanged graph revision, and concatenated pages SHALL conserve unique canonical IDs. `PHASE_NOT_FOUND` and `EMPTY_PHASE` SHALL remain distinct. Large `read_spec_doc` requests SHALL not bypass the default/max page bounds without explicit whole-document opt-in, and missing sections SHALL return nearest canonical anchors.

## NFR-Performance-14 (FR-83)

**No duplicate graph or hook pipeline:** A Codex host invocation SHALL create no second SpecGraph build, MCP registry, task store, or parallel guard chain solely because of the host. Hook adaptation SHALL add one bounded normalization/dispatch pass before the existing policy. Performance verification SHALL compare repo and installed variants against the same canonical corpus and report any regression explicitly; it SHALL not hide startup work in a pre-warmed checkout.

## NFR-Reliability-17 (FR-83)

**Deterministic adapter and package parity:** Equal canonical source bytes and generator version SHALL produce byte-equivalent Codex skills, hook manifest, agent profiles, MCP consumer map, plugin manifest inputs, and fingerprints. A missing, stale, manually divergent, or partially generated artifact SHALL fail the distribution check with source and target paths. Unsupported host spawn or semantic judge capability SHALL remain an explicit NOT_READY/SEMANTIC_SKIPPED state.

## NFR-Security-11 (FR-83)

**Target confinement and guard parity:** Every installed MCP operation SHALL canonicalize and remain within the selected target repository root even when the executable and cwd are in a plugin cache. Codex raw-file and shell payloads SHALL receive the same enforce decision as their Claude-equivalent intent. Cache paths, external symlink/junction targets, and unresolved roots SHALL be rejected before reading or mutation; diagnostic output SHALL not expose secrets.
