# Cucumber Message fixture

`cucumber-messages.ndjson` is an unmodified real Cucumber Message stream captured by the repository's unfiltered Docker BDD producer. Semantic rejection scenarios mutate parsed envelopes only in memory.

`cucumber-messages.provenance.json` is a closed v2 receipt. `cucumber-messages.inputs.json` lists every content-addressed producer input outside this fixture directory. The fixture loader re-hashes the stream, source manifest, every listed current input, and the aggregate before any release oracle or mutation is used. `parentFixtureSha256` records the prior real stream used by the self-hosting mutation scenarios during capture; it is not relabeled as current output.

Ground truth: the stream contains all 11 MRI scenario IDs and all 12 source-derived MRI pickle executions. Every required pickle has one test case and a complete passing terminal chain; the stream has one final successful `testRunFinished`. The evaluator rejects malformed/meta-only, missing or duplicate chain members, missing non-first outline expansions, retry-only and non-passing evidence with named `CucumberEvidenceError` codes.
